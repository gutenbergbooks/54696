<span class="medium">OUR TITLE</span></h2>

<p>To choose a title that will felicitously fit the lifework
of an artist is no easy matter, especially
when the product is a very varied one, and the
producer is disposed to take a modest estimate of
its value.</p>

<p>In the present case the titles that have suggested
themselves to one or other of those concerned in
the selection have not been few, and a friendly
contest has ensued over the desire of the artist
on the one hand to belittle, and of author and
publishers on the other to fairly appraise, both
the ground which her work covers and the
qualities which it contains.</p>

<p>The first point to be considered in giving the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
volume a name was that it forms one of a series
in which an endeavour&mdash;and, to judge by public
appreciation, a successful endeavour&mdash;has been
made to illustrate in colour an artist’s impressions
of a particular country: as, for instance, Mr. John
Fulleylove’s of the Holy Land, Mr. Talbot Kelly’s
of Egypt, and Mr. Mortimer Menpes’s of Japan.
Now Mrs. Allingham throughout her work has
been steadfast in her adherence to the portrayal
of one country only. She has never travelled or
painted outside Europe, and within its limits only
at one place outside the British Isles, namely,
Venice. Even in her native country her work
has been strictly localised. Neither Scotland nor
Wales has attracted her attention since the days
when she first worked seriously as an artist, and
Ireland has only received a scanty meed, and that
due to family ties. England, therefore, was the
one and only name under which her work could
be included within the series, and that has very
properly been assigned to it.</p>

<p>But it will be seen that to this has been added
the prefix “Happy,” thereby drawing down the
disapprobation of certain of the artist’s friends,
who, recognising her as a resident in Hampstead,
have associated the title with that alliterative one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
which the northern suburbs have received at the
hands of the Bank Holiday visitant; and they
facetiously surmise that the work may be called
“’Appy England! By a Denizen of ’Appy ’Ampstead!”</p>

<p>But a glance at the illustrations by any one
unacquainted with Mrs. Allingham’s residential
qualifications, and by the still greater number
ignorant even of her name (for these, in spite of
her well-earned reputation, will be the majority,
taking the countries over which this volume will
circulate), must convince such an one that the
“England” requires and deserves not only a
qualifying but a commendatory prefix, and that
the best that will fit it is that to which the artist
has now submitted.</p>

<p>We say a “qualifying” title, because within its
covers we find only a one-sided and partial view
of both life and landscape. None of the sterner
realities of either are presented. In strong opposition
to the tendency of the art of the later
years of the nineteenth century, the baser side
of life has been studiously avoided, and nature
has only been put down on paper in its happiest
moods and its pleasantest array. Storm and stress
in both life and landscape are altogether absent.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
We say, further, a “commendatory” title, because
as regards both life and landscape it is, throughout,
a mirror of halcyon days. If sickness intrudes on
a single occasion, it is in its convalescent stage;
if old age, it is in a “Haven of Rest”; the wandering
pedlar finds a ready market for her wares, the
tramp assistance by the wayside. In both life and
landscape it is a portrayal of youth rejoicing in
its youth. For the most part it represents childhood,
and, if we are to believe Mr. Ruskin, for the
first time in modern Art; for in his lecture on Mrs.
Allingham at Oxford, he declared that “though
long by academic art denied or resisted, at last
bursting out like one of the sweet Surrey fountains,
all dazzling and pure, you have the radiance
and innocence of reinstated infant divinity showered
again among the flowers of English meadows of
Mrs. Allingham.”</p>

<p>This healthiness, happiness, and joy of life,
coupled with an idyllic beauty, reveals itself in
every figure in Mrs. Allingham’s story, so that
even the drudgery of rural life is made to appear
as a task to be envied.</p>

<p>And the same joyous and happy note is to be
found in her landscapes. Every scene is</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full in the smile of the blue firmament.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<p>One feels that</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">Every flower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoys the air it breathes.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Rain, wind, or lowering skies find no place in
any of them, but each calls forth the expression</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">What a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sun one and do nothing!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No attempt is made to select the sterner effects
of landscape which earlier English painters so
persistently affected. With the rough steeps of
Hindhead at her door, the artist’s feet have
almost invariably turned towards the lowlands and
the reposeful forms of the distant South Downs.
Cottages, farmsteads, and flower gardens have been
her choice in preference to dales, crags, and fells.</p>

<p>And in so selecting, and so delineating, she has
certainly catered for the happiness of the greater
number.</p>

<p>What does the worker, long in city pent, desire
when he cries</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">’Tis very sweet to look into the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open face of heaven?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And what does the banished Englishman oftenest
turn his thoughts to, even although he may be dwelling
under aspects of nature which many would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
think far more beautiful than those of his native
land? Browning in his “Home Thoughts from
Abroad” gives consummate expression to the
homesickness of many an exile:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh! to be in England<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that April’s there!<br /></span>
<div class="i0"><hr class="tb" /><br /></div>
<span class="i0">All will be gay when noontide wakes anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Buttercups, the little children’s dower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far brighter than this gaudy melon flower!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And Keats also&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Happy is England! I could be content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see no other verdure than its own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel no other breezes than are blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through its tall woods, with high romances blent.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These, the poets’ longings, suggested the prefix
for which so lengthy an apology has been made,
and which, in spite of the artist’s demur, we have
pressed upon her acceptance, confident that the
public verdict will be an acquittal against any
charge either of exaggeration, or that he who
excuses himself accuses himself.</p>

<p>If an apology is due it is in respect of the
letterpress. The necessity of maintaining the size
to which the public has been accustomed in the
series of which this forms a part, and of interleaving
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
the numerous illustrations which it contains,
means the provision of a certain number
of words. Now an artist’s life that has been
passed amid such pleasant surroundings as has
that of Mrs. Allingham, cannot contain a sufficiency
of material for the purpose. Indulgence
must, therefore, be granted when it is found that
much of the contents consists merely of the writer’s
descriptions of the illustrations, a discovery which
might suggest that they were primarily the <i>raison
d’&ecirc;tre</i> of the volume.</p>

<p>As regards the illustrations, a word must be
said.</p>

<p>The remarkable achievements in colour reproduction,
through what is known as the “three-colour
process,” have enabled the public to be
placed in possession of memorials of an artist’s
work in a way that was not possible even so
recently as a year or two ago. Hitherto self-respecting
painters have very rightly demurred to
any colour reproductions of their work being made
except by processes whose cost and lengthy procedure
prohibited quantity as well as quality.
Mrs. Allingham herself, in view of previous
attempts, was of the same opinion until a trial of
the process now adopted convinced her to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
contrary. Now she is happy that a leap forward
in science has enabled renderings in little of her
water-colours to be offered to thousands who did
not know them previously.</p>

<p>The water-colours selected for reproduction
have been brought together from many sources,
and at much inconvenience to their owners. Both
artist and publishers ask me to take this opportunity
of thanking those whose names will be
found in the List of Illustrations, for the generosity
with which they have placed the originals at
their disposal.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Allingham’s wish that the illustrations
should be placed in order of date, and this
has been done as far as possible; but this and
the following chapter being in a way introductory,
it has been deemed advisable to interleave them
with three or four which do not fall in with the
rest as regards subject or locality. For reasons of
convenience the description of each drawing is not
inserted in the body, but at the end of the chapter
in which it appears.

<p>A portrait of Vi, the daughter of the farmer at

<p>Mrs. Allingham was tempted to take up again
her disused practice of portrait-painting, by the
attraction of the combination of the yellow of the
child’s hair and hat, the red of the roses, and the
blue of the distant hillside.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mrs. E. Lamb.</i><br />

<p>Berkshire, in spite of its notable places and
situation, does not boast of much in the way of
county chronicles, and little can be learnt by one
whose sole resource is a Murray’s <i>Guide</i> concerning
the interesting village where the scene of this drawing
is laid, for it is there dismissed in a couple of
lines.</p>

<p>Hagbourne, or Hagborne, is one of the many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
“bornes” which (in the counties bordering on the
Thames, as elsewhere) takes its Saxon affix from
one of the burns or brooks which find their way
from thence into the neighbouring river. It lies
off the Great Western main line, and its fine
church may be seen a mile away to the southward
just before arriving at Didcot. This proximity to
a considerable railway junction has not disturbed
much of its old-world character.</p>

<p>The buildings and the Cross, which make a
delightful harmony in greys, probably looked much
the same when Cavalier and Puritan harried this
district in the Civil War, for with Newbury on one
side and Oxford on the other, they must oftentimes
have been up and down this, the main street of the
village. The Cross has long since lost its meaning.
The folk from the countryside no longer bring
their butter, eggs, and farm produce for local sale.
The villagers have to be content with margarine,
French eggs, and other foreign commodities from
the local “stores,” and the Cross steps are now
only of use for infant energies to practise their
powers of jumping from. So, too, the sun-dial on
the top, which does not appear to have ever been
surmounted by a cross, is now useless, for everybody
either has a watch or is sufficiently notified as to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
meal times by a “buzzer” at the railway works
hard by.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham says that most of her drawings
are marked in her memory by some local comment
concerning them. In this case a bystander sympathetically
remarked that it seemed “a mighty
tedious job,” in that of “Milton’s House” that “it
was a foolish little thing when you began”&mdash;the
most favourable criticism she ever encountered only
amounting to “Why, it’s almost worth framing!”</p>

<p>One of the simplest, and yet one of the most
satisfying of Mrs. Allingham’s compositions.</p>

<p>It is clearly not a morning to stay indoors with
needlework which neither in size nor importance
calls for table or chair. Besides, at the cottage
gate there is a likelier chance of interruption and
conversation with occasional passers-by. But, at
no time numerous on this Surrey hillside, these are
altogether lacking at the moment, and the pink-frocked
maiden has to be content with the very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
mild distraction afforded by the overtures of the
family robin, who is always ready to open up converse
and to waste his time also in manœuvres and
pretended explorations over ground in her vicinity,
which he well knows to be altogether barren of
provender.

<p>The fair sex is so much in evidence in Art to-day
(the first census of this century recording the names
of nearly four thousand who profess that calling)
that we are apt to forget that the lady artist,
worthy of a place amongst the foremost of the
other sex, is a creation of modern growth.</p>

<p>Paintresses&mdash;to call them by a quaint and agreeable
name&mdash;there have been in profusion, and an
author, writing a quarter of a century ago, managed
to fill two bulky volumes<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> with their biographies;
but the majority of these have owed both their
practice and their place in Art to the fact of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
fathers or husbands having been engaged in that
profession.</p>

<p>History has recorded but little concerning the
women artists who worked in the early days of
English Art. The scanty records which, however,
have come down to us prove that if they
lived uneventful lives they did so in comfort. For
instance, it is noted of the first that passes across the
pages of English history, namely Susannah Hornebolt
(all the early names were foreign), that she
lived for many years in great favour and esteem
at the King’s Court, and died rich and honoured:
of the next, Lavinia Teerlinck, that she also died
rich and respected, having received in her prime
a higher salary than Holbein, and from Queen
Elizabeth, later on in life, a quarterly wage of &pound;41.
Farther on we find Charles I. giving to Anne
Carlisle and Vandyck, at one time, as much ultramarine
as cost him &pound;500, and Anna Maria Carew
obtaining from Charles II. in 1662 a pension of
&pound;200 a year. About the same time Mary Beale,
who is described as passing a tranquil, modest
existence, full of sweetness, dignity, and matronly
purity, earned the same amount from her brush,
charging &pound;5 for a head, and &pound;10 for a half-length.
She died in 1697, and was buried under the communion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
table in St. James’s, Piccadilly, a church
which holds the remains of other paintresses.</p>

<p>Another, Mary Delaney, described as “lovely in
girlhood and old age,” and who must have been a
delightful personage from the testimonies which
have come down to us concerning her, lived almost
through the eighteenth century, being born in 1700,
and dying in 1788, and being, also, buried in St.
James’s. She has left on record that “I have been
very busy at my usual presumption of copying
beautiful nature”; but the many copies of that
kind that she must have made during this long life
are all unknown to those who have studied Art
a hundred years later.</p>

<p>Midway in the eighteenth century we come
across the great and unique event in the annals
of Female Art, namely the election of two ladies to
the Academic body, in the persons of Angelica
Kauffman&mdash;who was one of the original signatories
of the memorial to George III., asking him to
found an Academy, and who passed in as such on
the granting of that privilege&mdash;and Mary Moser,
who probably owed her election to the fact that her
father was Keeper of the newly-founded body.</p>

<p>The only other lady artists who flit across the
stage during the latter half of that century&mdash;in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
case of whom any attempt at distinction or recognition
is possible&mdash;were Frances Reynolds, the
sister of the President, and the “dearest dear” of
Dr. Johnson, and Maria Cosway, the wife of the
miniaturist. These kept up the tradition of ladies
always being connected with Art by parentage or
marriage.</p>

<p>The Academy catalogues of the first half of the
nineteenth century may be searched in vain for
any name whose fame has endured even to these
times, although the number of lady exhibitors was
considerable. In the exhibitions of fifty years ago,
of 900 names, 67, or 7 per cent, were those of the
fair sex, the majority being termed in the alphabetical
list “Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;, as above”; that is to say,
they bore the surname and lived at the same
addresses as the exhibitor who preceded them.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>The admission of women to the Royal Academy
Schools in 1860 must not only have had much to do
with increasing the numbers of paintresses, but in
raising the standard of their work. In recent years,
at the annual prize distributions of that institution,
when they present themselves in such interesting
and serried ranks, they have firmly established their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
right to work alongside of the men, by carrying off
many of the most important awards.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>The Royal Female School of Art, the Slade
School, and Schools of Art everywhere throughout
the country each and all are now engaged in
swelling the ranks of the profession with a far
greater number of aspirants to a living than there
is any room for.</p>

<p>This invasion of womankind into Art, which
has also shown itself in a remarkable way in
poetry and fiction, is in no way to be decried.
On the contrary, it has come upon the present
generation as a delightful surprise, as a breath
of fresh and sweet-scented air after the heavy
atmosphere which hung over Art in the later days
of the nineteenth century. To mention a few only:
Miss Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler), Lady
Alma Tadema, Mrs. Jopling, Miss Dicksee, Mrs.
Henrietta Rae, Miss Kemp Welch, and Miss
Brickdale in oil painting; Mrs. Angell, Miss Clara
Montalba, Miss Gow, Miss Kate Greenaway, and
Mrs. Allingham in water-colours have each looked
at Art in a distinguished manner, and one quite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
distinct from that of their fellow-workers of the
sterner sex.</p>

<p>The ladies named all entered upon their profession
with a due sense of its importance. Many
of them may perhaps be counted fortunate in
having commenced their careers before the newer
ideas came into vogue, by virtue of which anybody
and everybody may pose as an artist, now that it
entails none of that lengthy apprenticeship which
from all time has been deemed to be a necessary
preliminary to practice. Even so lately as the date
when Mrs. Allingham came upon the scene, draftsmanship
and composition were still regarded as a
matter of some importance if success was to be
achieved. Nature, as represented in Art, was still
subjected to a process of selection, a selection, too,
of its higher in preference to its lower forms. The
same pattern was not allowed to serve for every
tree in the landscape whatever be its growth, foliage,
or the local influences which have affected its form.
A sufficient study of the human and of animal forms
to admit of their introduction, if needful, into that
landscape was not deemed superfluous. Most important
of all, beauty still held the field, and the
cult of unvarnished ugliness had not captured the
rising generation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The endeavours of women in what is termed very
erroneously the higher branch of the profession,
have not as yet received the reward that is their
due. Placed at the Royal Academy under practically
the same conditions as the male sex whilst
under tuition, both as regards fortune and success,
their pictures, when they mount from the Schools
in the basement to the Exhibition Galleries on the
first floor of Burlington House, carry with them
no further possibility of reward, even although, as
they have done, they hold the pride of place there.
It is true that as each election to the Academic
body comes round rumours arise as to the chances
of one or other of the fair sex forcing an entrance
through the doors that, with the two exceptions
we have named, have been barred to them since the
foundation of the Institution. The day, however,
when their talent in oil painting, or any other art
medium, will be recognised by Academic honours
has yet to come.</p>

<p>To their honour be it said, the undoubted capacities
of ladies have not passed unrecognised by water-colour
painters. Both the Royal Society and the
Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours have
enrolled amongst their ranks the names of women
who have been worthy exponents of the Art.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The practice of water-colour art would appear
to appeal especially to womankind, as not only
are the constituents which go to its making of
a more agreeable character than those of oil, but
the whole machinery necessary for its successful
production is more compact and capable of adaptation
to the ordinary house. The very methods
employed have a certain daintiness about them
which coincides with a lady’s delicacy. The work
does not necessitate hours of standing, with evil-smelling
paints, in a large top-lit studio, but can be
effected seated, in any living room which contains
a window of sufficient size. There is no need to
leave all the materials about while the canvasses
dry, and no preliminary setting of palettes and
subsequent cleaning off.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this the water-colour art during
the first century of its existence was practised
almost solely by the male sex, and it was not until
the middle of the Victorian reign that a few women
came on to the scene, and at once showed themselves
the equals of the male sex, not only so far
as proficiency but originality was concerned. In
the case of no one of these was there any imitation
or following of a master; but each struck out for
herself what was, if not a new line, certainly a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
presentation of an old one in a novel form. Mrs.
Angell, better known perhaps as Helen Coleman,
took up the portrayal of flowers and still life, which
had been carried to such a pitch of minute finish
by William Hunt, and treated it with a breadth,
freedom, and freshness that delighted everybody.
It secured for her at once a place amid a section
of water-colourists who found it very difficult to
obtain these qualities in their work. Miss Clara
Montalba went to Venice and painted it under
aspects which were entirely different from those of
her predecessors, such as James Holland; and she
again has practically held the field ever since as
regards that particular phase of atmospheric effect
which has attracted attention to her achievement.
The kind of work and the subjects taken up by
Mrs. Allingham will be dealt with at greater length
hereafter, but I may premise by saying that she,
too, ultimately settled into methods that are entirely
her own, and such as no one can accuse her
of having derived from anybody else.</p>

<p>The popularity of a poet can hardly be gauged by
the number of visitors to the haunts wherein he
passed his day. Rather are they numbered by
the proximity of a railroad thereto. Consequently
it is not surprising that the pilgrims to the little
out-of-the-way Buckinghamshire village where
Milton completed his <i>Paradise Lost</i> are an inconsiderable
percentage of those who journey to
Stratford-on-Avon. For though Chalfont St. Giles
lies only a short distance away from the twenty-third
milestone on the high-road from London to
Aylesbury, it is some three miles from the nearest
station&mdash;a station, too, where few conveyances are
obtainable. Motor cars which will take the would-be
pilgrim in an hour from a Northumberland Avenue
hotel may increase its popularity, but at present
the village of the “pretty box,” as Milton called
the house, is as slumberous and as little changed
as it was in the year 1665, when Milton fled thither
from his house in Artillery Ground, Bunhill Row,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
before the terror of the plague.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> Milton was then
fifty-seven, and is described as a pale, but not
cadaverous man, dressed neatly in black, with his
hands and fingers gouty, and with chalk-stones.
He loved a garden, and would never take a house,
not even in London, without one, his habit being
to sit in the sun in his garden, or in the colder
weather to pace it for three or four hours at a
stretch. Many of his verses he composed or pruned
as he thus walked, coming in to dictate them to his
amanuensis, and it was from the vernal to the
autumnal equinox that his intermittent inspiration
bore its fruit. His only other recreation besides
conversation was music, and he sang, and played
either the organ or the bass viol. It was at
Chalfont that Milton put into the hands of
Ellwood his completed <i>Paradise Lost</i>, with a
request that he would return it to him with his
judgment thereupon. It was here also that on
receiving Ellwood’s famous opinion, “Thou hast
said much here of Paradise Lost, but what hast
thou to say of Paradise Found?” he commenced
his <i>Paradise Regained</i>. He returned to
London after the plague abated, in time to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
it again devastated by the fresh calamity of the
great fire.</p>

<p>An engraving of this house appears in Dunster’s
edition of <i>Paradise Regained</i>, and an account in
Todd’s <i>Life of Milton</i>, p. 272; also in Jesse’s
<i>Favourite Haunts</i>, p. 62.</p>

<p>That several of Mrs. Allingham’s drawings
should illustrate scenes connected with Great
Britain’s poets is not remarkable, seeing that her
life has been so intimately bound up with one of
them, but it is at first somewhat startling to find
that the two selected for illustration here should
treat of Milton and Waller, for was it not the
latter who said of <i>Paradise Lost</i> that it was distinguished
only by its length. The accident that
has brought them together here is perhaps that the
two scenes are near neighbours, and, may be, the
artist was tempted to paint the old oak through
kindly sentiments towards the author of the sweet-smelling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
lines, “Go, Lovely Rose,” by which his
name endures.</p>

<p>Coleshill, where the oak stands, is a “woody
hamlet” near Amersham, and a mile or two away
from Chalfont St. Giles. The tree which bears
his name, and under which he is said to have composed
much of his verse, dates from long anterior to
the late days of the Monarchy, when he was more
engaged in hatching plots than in writing verse.
If, as is probable, he viewed and sought its comforting
shade, he can hardly have believed that it
would survive the fame of him who received such
praise from his contemporaries as to be acclaimed
“inter poetas sui temporis facile princeps.”</p>

<p>A charming little picture made out of the
simplest details is this spring scene in an Isle of
Wight lane. But if the details are of the simplest
character, as much cannot be said for the methods
employed by the artist in their treatment. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
are so intricate that the drawing was perhaps the
most difficult of any to reproduce, owing to the
impossibility of accurately translating the subtle
gradations which distinguish the tender greenery
of trees, hedgerow, and bank.

<span class="large">THE ARTIST’S EARLY WORK</span></h2>

<p>Mrs. Allingham, whose maiden name was Helen
Paterson, was born on September 26, 1848, near
Burton-on-Trent, Derbyshire, where her father,
Alexander Henry Paterson, M.D., had a medical
practice. As her name implies, she is of Scottish
descent on the paternal side. A year after her
birth her family removed to Altrincham in Cheshire,
where her father died suddenly, in 1862, of diphtheria,
caught in attending a patient.</p>

<p>This unforeseen blow broke up the Cheshire
household, and the widow shortly afterwards
wended her way with her young family to
Birmingham, where the next few years, the most
impressionable of our young artist’s life, were to
be spent amid surroundings which at that date
were in no wise conducive to influencing her in
the direction of Art of any kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>Scribbling out of her head on any material she
could lay hold of (not even sparing the polished
surfaces of the Victorian furniture) had been her
chief pleasure as a child; and as she grew older
she drew from Nature with interest and ease,
especially during family visits to Kenilworth and
other country and seaside places. Some friends
in Birmingham started a drawing club which met
each month at houses of the different members,
and the young student was kindly invited to join
it. Subjects were fixed upon and the drawings were
shown and discussed at each meeting. More good
resulted from this than might have been expected,
for some of the members were not only persons
of taste but were collectors of fine examples in
Art, which were also seen and considered at the
meetings. Helen Paterson, finding that her pen-and-ink
productions were more satisfactory than
her colour attempts, came to hope that she might
gradually qualify herself for book illustration, instead
of earning a living by teaching, as she at first
anticipated her future would be.</p>

<p>Two influences greatly helped the girl in her
artistic desires at this time.</p>

<p>Helen Paterson’s mother’s sister, Laura Herford,
had taken up Art as a profession. Although her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
name does not often appear in Exhibition records,
the sisterhood of artists owe her a very enduring
debt. For to her was due that opening of the
Royal Academy Schools to women to which I
have already referred, and which she obtained
through another’s slip of the tongue, aided by a
successful subterfuge.</p>

<p>Lord Lyndhurst, at a Royal Academy banquet,
in singing the praises of that institution, claimed
that its schools offered free tuition to <i>all</i> Her
Majesty’s subjects. Within a few days he received
from Miss Herford a communication pointing out
the inaccuracy of his statement, inasmuch as tuition
was only given to the male and not to the female
sex, which comprised the majority of Her Majesty’s
subjects. She therefore appealed to him to use
his influence with the Government to obtain the
removal of the restriction. He did so, and the
Government, on addressing Sir Charles Eastlake,
the President of the Royal Academy, found in him
one altogether in sympathy with such a reform.
He replied to the Government that there was no
<i>written</i> law against the admission of women, and
after an interview with the lady he connived at a
drawing of hers being sent in as a test of her
capability for admission as a probationer, under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
initials merely of her Christian names. A few days
subsequently a notification that he had passed the
test and obtained admission arrived at her home
addressed to A. L. Herford, Esq. There was of
course a demonstration when the lady presented
herself in answer to the summons to execute a
drawing in the presence of the Keeper; and her
claim to stay and do this was vehemently combated
by the Council, to whom it was of course
referred. But the President demonstrated the
absurdity of the situation, and so strongly advocated
the untenability of the position that the
door was opened once and for all to female
students. This lady, who had a strong character
in many other directions, constituted herself Art-adviser-in-chief
to her young niece from the time
of her father’s death.</p>

<p>The other influence under which Helen Paterson
came at this critical period was that of a
capable and sympathetic master at Birmingham.
In Mr. Raimbach, the head of the Birmingham
School of Design, she encountered a man who was
a teacher, born not made, and who, not being
hidebound with the old dry-as-dust traditions, saw
and fostered whatever gifts were to be found in his
pupils. He it was who, interesting himself in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
desire to learn to draw the human figure, and to
study more of its anatomy than could be gained
from the casts of the School of Design and from
the lifeless programme which existed there, encouraged
her to go to London for wider study, in
the hope of gaining entrance into the Academy
Schools, and taking up Art as a profession under
her aunt’s auspices.</p>

<p>She followed his advice, gave up a single pupil
she had acquired, and passed into the Academy
Schools in April 1867 after a short preliminary
course at the Female School of Art, Queen’s
Square.</p>

<p>British Art may congratulate itself that in
Helen Paterson’s case, as in that of so many others,
“there’s a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew
them how we will.” It is very certain that had the
fates ordained that she should remain in Birmingham
her talent would never have flowed into the
channel which has made possible a memoir of her
Art under the title of “Happy England.” The
environments of that great city are such that it
would have been practically impossible for her
artistic training to have been as her divinity decreed
it should be, or to place means of exercising
it within her grasp should she have desired them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>During the first year or two at the Royal
Academy Helen Paterson worked in the antique
school, where the study of drawing, proportion
of the figure, with some anatomy, precluded the
thought of painting. When raised to the painting
school she, like many another capable student
then as now, was at first driven hither and thither
by the variety of and apparently contradictory
advice that she received from her masters. For
one month she was under a visitor with strongly
defined ideas in one direction, and the next under
some one else who was equally assertive in another,
and it was some time before she could strike
a balance for her own understanding. But, for
reasons which those who know her well will recognise,
she received help and kindness from all, and,
as she gratefully remembers, from none more than
from Millais, Frederick Leighton, Frederick Goodall,
Fred Walker, Stacy Marks, and John Pettie.
Millais especially could in a minute or two impart
something which was never afterwards forgotten,
whilst the encouragement of all was most stimulating
to a beginner. Another artist who has been a
life-long adviser and the kindest of friends, was
Briton Riviere, with whom and whose family an
intimacy began even in her student days. An
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
invitation to stay with them at St. Andrews on
the coast of Fife in the summer of 1872 inaugurated
Miss Paterson’s first serious work from
Nature. The result was deemed to be satisfactory
by Mr. Riviere, who helped to dissipate a certain
despondency and fear which had sprung up in
the young artist’s mind as regards her colour
powers. It was not, however, in the grey houses
and uninteresting streets of this old northern university
town, to which she first turned, that the
true relations between tone and colour discovered
themselves to her longing eye, but amongst the
sandbanks, seaweed, and blue water which fringe
its noted golf-links. For the first time the artist
felt herself happy in attempting to work in any
other medium than black and white. Just prior
to this fortunate visit she had in the spring of the
year been taken by an old friend of the family to
Rome, where she had worked assiduously at Nature,
but with little satisfaction so far as she herself was
concerned.</p>

<p>She had by this time fully made up her mind to
embark on a career in which she was determined,
and was in fact obliged, to earn a living; and as her
colour work at present had no market, there was
nothing for it but to procure a livelihood by black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and white. Wood engraving, although nearing
the end of its existence, was still the only medium
of cheap illustration. Photography later on came
to its aid to a certain extent, but the majority of the
original drawings continued to be drawn directly
on to the wood block. There were still close upon
a hundred wood engravers employed in London,
working for the most part under master engravers,
into whose hands the publishers of magazines,
illustrated periodicals, and books entrusted, not
only the cutting of the block, but the selection of
the artist to make the drawing upon it.</p>

<p>It was to these that Helen Paterson had to
look for work, and it was upon a round of their
offices that in the autumn of 1869 she diffidently
started with a portfolio full of drawings. Employment
did not come at once, and the list of seventy
names with which she started had been considerably
reduced before, to her great satisfaction, a
drawing out of her sheaf was taken by Mr. Joseph
Swain, to whom she had an introduction, for submission
to the proprietors of <i>Once a Week</i>. It
was accepted, and she copied it on to the wood.
Gradually she obtained work for other magazines,
including <i>Little Folks</i>, published by Cassell, and
<i>Aunt Judy</i>, by George Bell, the drawings for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
<i>Aunt Judy</i> illustrating Mrs. Ewing’s <i>A Flat Iron
for a Farthing</i>, <i>Jan of the Windmill</i>, and <i>Six to
Sixteen</i>.</p>

<p>The first alteration of any magnitude of the
custom to which reference has been made, namely,
of the artist having to look to the engraver for
work, occurred when the <i>Graphic</i> newspaper was
started in the year 1870. Mr. W. L. Thomas, to
whom the credit of this improvement in the status
of the worker in black and white was due, was
himself an artist and a member of the Institute of
Painters in Water Colours. As such he was not
only in touch with, but capable of appreciating the
unusual amount of budding talent of abundant
promise which was just then presenting itself.
This he enlisted in the service of the <i>Graphic</i> upon
what may be termed co-operative terms, for those
who liked could have half their payment in cash
and half in shares in the venture. Many, the
majority we believe, unfortunately could not afford
the latter proposition. Unfortunately indeed, for
the paper embarked on a career which has yielded
dividends, at times of over a hundred per cent, and
has kept the shares at a premium, which few companies
in existence can boast of. This phenomenal
success was in a large measure the result of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
personal interest that was brought to bear upon
every department, and that every employ&eacute; took
in his share in it. The illustrations, upon which
success mainly depended, were not the product of
a formulated system, working in a groove, where
blocks were served out to artists as to a machine,
without any regard to their fitness for the particular
piece of work. Artists of capacity, whose names
are now to be found amongst the most noted in
the academic roll, were selected for the particular
illustration that suited them, and were well paid
for it. The public was not only astonished at,
but grateful for, the result, and showed their appreciation
by at once placing the <i>Graphic</i> in the
high position which it deserved and has since
enjoyed.</p>

<p>Helen Paterson was so fortunate as to be
brought into touch with Mr. Thomas shortly after
the first appearance of the paper. She had obtained
some work from one Harrall, an engraver, with
whom Mr. Thomas had had business connections
in the past, and it was at Harrall’s suggestion that
she went to Mr. Thomas, who at once offered her
a place on the staff of the <i>Graphic</i>, a place which
she retained until her marriage in 1874. It was
indeed a godsend to her, for it meant not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
regular work but handsome pay. Twelve guineas
for a full, and eight for a half page, and at least one
of these a week, meant not merely maintenance,
but a reserve against that rainy day which, fortunately,
the subject of our memoir has never had to
contend with.</p>

<p>The subjects which Miss Paterson was called
upon to produce were of the most diversified character,
but all of them had figures as their main
feature. To properly limn these she had to
employ regular models, but she also enlisted the
aid of her fellow-students, for she was still at the
Royal Academy, and her sketch-books of that
time, of which she has many, are full of studies
of artists, no few of whom have since become
celebrated in the world of Art.</p>

<p>Looking through the pages of the <i>Graphic</i> with
the artist, it is interesting to note the variety of
episodes upon which Mr. Thomas employed her.
Her drawings were not always from her own
sketches, being at times from originals that had
been sent to the paper in an embryo condition
necessitating entire revision, or from rapid notes
by artists sent to represent the paper at important
functions. But on occasions she was also deputed
to attend at these, and in consequence underwent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
some novel experiences for a young girl. A meeting
at Mr. Gladstone’s, Fashions in the Park, Flower
Shows at the Botanical Gardens, Archery at the
Toxophilite Society’s,&mdash;these formed the lighter
side of her work, the more serious being the illustration
of novels by novelists of note. This was
at the time a new feature in journalism. Amongst
those entrusted to her were <i>Innocent</i>, by Mrs.
Oliphant, and <i>Ninety-Three</i>, by Victor Hugo. For
the murder trial in the former she had to visit the
Central Criminal Court, and through so doing was
more accurate than the authoress, who admittedly
had not been there, and whose work consequently
showed several glaring mistakes, such as the
prisoner addressing the judge by name. She was
also employed upon a novel of Charles Reade’s in
conjunction with Mr. Luke Fildes and Mr. Henry
Woods. This she undertook with extreme diffidence,
for Reade had sent round a circular saying
that he greatly disliked having his stories illustrated
at all; but as it had to be in this case, he begged
to notify that <i>he</i> gave <i>situations</i>, whilst George
Eliot and Anthony Trollope only gave conversations,
and he requested that good use should be
made of these situations. Meeting him some years
afterwards, the author paid her the compliment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
saying he liked her illustration of the heroine in
his story the best of any.</p>

<p>Nor was Miss Paterson entirely dependent upon
the <i>Graphic</i>, whose illustrations, oftentimes given
out in a hurry, had to be finished within a period
limited by hours. She was fortunate to be
numbered amongst the select few who worked for
the <i>Cornhill</i>, for which she was, through Mr. Swain’s
kind offices, asked to illustrate Hardy’s <i>Far from
the Madding Crowd</i>, which was at first attributed
to George Eliot. The author was fairly complimentary
as to the result, although he said it was
difficult for two minds to imagine scenes in the
same light. Later on she had the pleasant task of
illustrating Miss Thackeray’s <i>Miss Angel</i> in the
same magazine. The drawing of Sir Joshua
Reynolds asking Angelica to marry him, perhaps
the best of the series, was one of the first to be
signed with the name of Allingham, by which she
has since been known.</p>

<p>A very interesting acquaintance with Sir Henry
Irving, which has lasted ever since, was commenced
in the early seventies through her having to visit
the Lyceum for the <i>Graphic</i> to delineate him and
Miss Isabel Bateman in <i>Richelieu</i>. Mr. Bateman,
who was then the manager, placed a box at her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
disposal, which she occupied for several nights
whilst making the drawing. One of the cottage
drawings reproduced here (<a href="#Plate_77">Plate 77</a>) belongs to
Sir Henry.</p>

<p>Although working regularly and almost continuously
at black and white during these years she
managed to intersperse it with some work in
colour, and at the exhibitions of the old Dudley
Gallery Art Society, which had been recently
founded, and which had proved a great boon
to rising and amateur art, she exhibited water-colours
under the title of “May,” “Dangerous
Ground,” and “Soldiers’ Orphans watching a bloodless
battle at Aldershot,” painted in the studio
from a <i>Graphic</i> drawing.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1874 Miss Paterson
was married to Mr. William Allingham, the well-known
poet, editor of <i>Fraser’s Magazine</i>, and friend
of so many of the celebrities in literature, science,
and art of the middle of the last century, amongst
whom may be mentioned Carlyle, Ruskin, Dante
Gabriel Rossetti, Browning, and Tennyson. It
was to be near the first named that the newly
married couple went to reside in Trafalgar Square,
Chelsea, where they passed the next seven years of
their married life, namely until 1881.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>To Carlyle Mrs. Allingham had the privilege of
frequent and familiar access during his last years;
and when he found that he was not expected to
pose to her, and that she had, as he emphatically
declared, a real talent for portraiture (the only form
of pictorial art in which he took any interest), he
became very kind and complaisant, and she was able
to make nearly a dozen portraits of him in water-colours.
An early one, which he declared made him
“look like an old fool,” was painted in the little
back garden of No. 5 Cheyne Row, which was not
without shade and greenery in the summer time.
There, in company with his pet cat “Tib,” and a
Paisley churchwarden (“no pipe good for anything,”
according to him, “being get-at-able in
England”), he indulged in smoking, the only
creature comfort that afforded him any satisfaction.
In these portraits he is depicted sitting in
his comfortable dressing-gown faded to a dim slaty
grey, refusing to wear a gorgeous oriental garment
that his admirers had presented to him. An
etching of one of these drawings appeared in the
<i>Art Journal</i> for 1882. Other portraits were
painted in the winter of 1878-79, in his long
drawing-room with its three windows looking out
into the street.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>Rossetti she never saw, although he had been an
intimate friend of her husband’s for twenty years<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
and was then living in Chelsea, for he was just
entering on that unfortunate epoch preceding his
death, when he was induced to cut himself adrift
from all his old circle of acquaintances. The fact
is regrettable, for it would have been interesting to
note his opinion of a lady’s work with which he
must have been in full sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. Allingham had known Ruskin for many
years. His wife’s acquaintance began in interesting
fashion at the Old Water-Colour Society’s.
She happened to be there during the Exhibition of
1877 at a time when the room was almost empty.
Mr. Ruskin had been looking at her drawing of
Carlyle, and introducing himself, asked her why
she had painted Carlyle like a lamb, when he ought
to be painted like a lion, as he was, and whether
she would paint the sage as such for him? To
this she had to reply that she could only paint him
as she saw him, which was certainly not in leonine
garb. One afternoon soon afterwards, Mr. Allingham
chanced to meet Ruskin at Carlyle’s, and
brought him round to see her work. She was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
at the time engaged on the drawing of “The
Clothes-Line” (<a href="#Plate_11">Plate 11</a>), and he objected to the
scarlet of the handkerchief, and also to the woman,
who he said ought to have been a rough workwoman,
an opinion which Mrs. Allingham did not
share with him at the time, but which she has
since felt to be a correct one. He also saw
another drawing with a grey sky, and asked her
why she did not make her skies blue. To her reply
that she thought there was often great beauty in
grey skies, he growled, “The devil sends grey
skies.”</p>

<p>Browning, an old friend of her husband’s, Mrs.
Allingham sometimes had the privilege of seeing
during her residence in London. One occasion
was typical of the man. He had been asked to
come and see her work, which was at the time
arranged at one end of a room at Trafalgar Square,
Chelsea, before sending in to the Exhibition. The
drawings were naturally small ones, and Browning
appeared to be altogether oblivious to their existence.
Turning round, with his back to them, he at
once commenced a story of some one who came to
see an artist’s work, and the artist was very huffed
because his visitor never took the slightest notice
of his pictures, but talked to him of other subjects
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
all the time. This, Browning considered, was
no sufficient ground for his huffiness. His
obliviousness to Mrs. Allingham’s drawings may
have been due to his having been accustomed to
the pictures of his son, which were of large size,
and in comparison with which Mrs. Allingham’s
would be quite invisible. Against this theory,
however, I may mention that on one occasion
I happened to have the good fortune to be present
in his son’s studio when Tennyson was announced.
Browning at once advanced to the door to meet
him, bent low, and addressed him as “Magister
Meus,” and although the Laureate had come to
see the paintings, and stayed some time, neither
of the two poets, so long as I was present, noticed
them in any way.</p>

<p>Whilst Mrs. Allingham was painting Carlyle,
Browning came to see him, and they held a most
interesting and delightful conversation on the
subject of the great French writers. The alteration
in Browning’s demeanour from his usual bluff
and breezy manner to a quiet, deferential tone
during the conversation was very notable.</p>

<p>Of her intimacy with Tennyson I may speak later
when we come to the drawings which illustrate his
two houses in Sussex and the Isle of Wight.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>

<p>The year of her marriage was also a landmark
in Mrs. Allingham’s career, through the Royal
Academy accepting and hanging two water-colours,
one entitled “The Milkmaid,” the other, “Wait
for Me,” the subject of the latter being a young
lady entering a cottage whilst a dog watched her
outside the gate. It would have been interesting
to have been able to insert a reproduction of either
of these in this volume, for they would probably
have shown that her fear as to her inability to
master colour was entirely without basis, but I
have not been able to trace them. The drawings
were not only well hung, but were sold during the
Exhibition.</p>

<p>It was, however, by another drawing that Mrs.
Allingham won her name.</p>

<p>In the year 1875 she was commissioned by Mr.
George Bell to make a water-colour from one of
the black-and-white drawings which she had done
some years before for Mrs. Ewing’s <i>A Flat Iron
for a Farthing</i>. We shall have occasion to describe
at length, later on, this delightful little
picture that is reproduced in <a href="#Plate_8">Plate 8</a>. It is only
necessary for our purpose here to state that it was
seen early in 1875 by that prince of landscape
water-colourists, Mr. Alfred Hunt.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>He was an old friend of Mr. Allingham’s, and
being told that his wife was thinking of trying
for election at the Royal Society of Painters in
Water Colours, kindly offered to go through her
portfolios. The From these he made a selection, and
promised to propose her at an election which was
about to take place. The result fully proved
the soundness of his choice, for the candidate not
only secured the rare distinction of being elected
on the first time of asking, but the still rarer one
of securing her place in that body, so notable for
its diversity of opinion when candidates are in
question, with hardly a dissentient vote.</p>

<p>Ladies were not admitted to the rank of full
members of the Society until the year 1890, when
she was, to her great pleasure and astonishment,
elected a full member. She deserved it; for much
of the charm of these exhibitions had been due to
the presence of the work which she has contributed
to every Exhibition held since her election save
two, one of these rare absences being due to her
having mistaken the date for sending in.</p>

<p>This election, and the fact that after her
marriage she could afford to do without the
monetary aid derived from black-and-white work,
decided her to embark upon water-colours; although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
in these she still confined her work to figure subjects,
more than one of which continued to be founded
on her previous work in monochrome.</p>

<p>The last book in which her name as an illustrator
appeared was, appropriately enough, <i>Rhymes
for the Young Folk</i>, by her husband, published
in <i>Cassell’s</i> in 1885, to which she contributed
most of the illustrations. She relinquished black-and-white
work without any regret, for although
she was much indebted to it, it never held her
sympathies, and she always longed to express
herself in colour, the medium in which she instinctively
felt she had ultimately the best chance
of success.</p>

<p>Although we are only separated from the
Chelsea of Mrs. Allingham’s days by little more
than a quarter of a century, its artistic associations
were then of a very different order to those
that are in evidence nowadays. The era of vast
studios in which duchesses and millionaires find
adequate surroundings for their portraits was not
yet. Whistler was close to old Chelsea Church,
a few doors only from where he recently died. Tite
Street, with which his name will always be connected,
was not yet built. He was still engaged
on those remarkable, but at that time insufficiently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
appreciated, canvases of scenes which
have now passed away, such as “Fireworks at
Cremorne,” and “Nocturnes” dimly disclosing old
Battersea Bridge. Seymour Haden was etching
the picturesque fa&ccedil;ade of the Walk, with his
brother-in-law’s house as a principal object in it,
and without the respectable embankment which
now makes it more reputable from a hygienic,
but less admirable from an artistic point of view.
Rossetti was practically the only other artist of
note in the quarter. But with one exception
Mrs. Allingham’s work was not reminiscent of
the place. That exception, however, disclosed to
her a field in which she foresaw much delight
and abundant possibilities. In the old Pensioners’
Garden at Chelsea Hospital were to be found
tenderly-cared-for borders of humble flowers.
The garden itself was a haven of repose for the
old warriors, and a show-place for their visitors.
Mrs. Allingham, like another artist, Hubert
Herkomer, about the same time, was touched by
the pathos of the surroundings, and, chiefly on the
urgency of her husband, she ventured on a drawing
of more importance than any hitherto attempted.
The subject, which we shall speak of again later,
was finished in 1877, and was the first large drawing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
exhibited by her at the Society of Painters in
Water Colours.</p>

<p>Painters&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;of the
garden are nowadays such a numerous body that
one is apt to forget that the time is quite recent
when to paint one with its flowers was a new
departure. It is nevertheless the fact, and in
taking it up, especially those that are associated
with the humbler type of cottages, Mrs. Allingham
was practically the originator of a new subject.
To the pensioners’ patches at Chelsea we are indebted
for the sweet portraits of humble flower-steads
which are now cherished by so many a
fortunate possessor, and charm every beholder.
Thus Chelsea aroused a desire to attack gardens
possessing greater possibilities than a town-stunted
patch, a desire that was not, however, gratified
until two years later when, during a visit in the
spring of 1879 to Shere, the first of many cottages
and flowers was painted from nature.</p>

<p>In 1881, after the death of Carlyle, Chelsea
had attractions for neither husband nor wife, and
with a young family growing up and calling for
larger and healthier quarters, the house in Trafalgar
Square was given up for one at Witley in Surrey,
a hamlet close to Haslemere, which she had visited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the year before, and in the midst of a country
which Birket Foster had already done much to
popularise, having resided at a beautiful house
there for many years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The water-colours of this first period, namely
from 1875 to 1880, that are reproduced here, are
the following:&mdash;</p>

<h3>8. THE YOUNG CUSTOMERS<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Miss Bell.</i><br />

Painted 1875.</span></h3>

<p>The drawing by which, as we have said, Mrs.
Allingham made her name, obtained election at the
Society of Painters in Water Colours, was represented
at her first appearance there in 1875, and
also at the Paris Exposition in 1878, and through
which she obtained the recognition of Ruskin, who
thus wrote concerning it in the <i>Notes</i> which he
was at that time in the habit of compiling each year
on the Summer Exhibitions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It happens curiously that the only drawing of which the
memory remains with me as a possession out of the Old Water-Colour
Exhibition of this year&mdash;Mrs. Allingham’s “Young
Customers”&mdash;should not only be by an accomplished designer
of woodcuts, but itself the illustration of a popular story.
The drawing, with whatever temporary purpose executed, is
for ever lovely&mdash;a thing which I believe Gainsborough would
have given one of his own paintings for, old fashioned as red-tipped
daisies are, and more precious than rubies.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, in 1883, in his lectures at Oxford on
Mrs. Allingham he again referred to it as “The
drawing which some years ago riveted, and ever
since has retained the public admiration&mdash;the two
deliberate housewives in their village toyshop, bent
on domestic utilities and economies, and proud in
the acquisition of two flat irons for a farthing&mdash;has
become, and rightly, a classic picture, which will
have its place among the memorable things in the
Art of our time, when many of its loudly-trumpeted
magnificences are remembered no more.”</p>

<p>The black-and-white drawing on which it was
founded, a somewhat thin and immature performance,
was one of twelve illustrations made by
Mrs. Allingham for Mrs. Ewing’s <i>A Flat Iron for
a Farthing</i>,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> where it appears as illustrating the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
following episode. It will be seen that Mrs.
Allingham’s version of the story differs in many
points from that of the authoress, which is thus
told by Reginald, the only son:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As I looked, there came down the hill a fine, large, sleek
donkey, led by an old man-servant, and having on its back
what is called a Spanish saddle, in which two little girls sat
side by side, the whole party jogging quietly along at a
foot’s pace in the sunshine. I was so overwhelmed and
impressed by the loveliness of these two children, and by
their quaint, queenly little ways, that time has not dimmed
one line in the picture that they then made upon my mind.
I can see them now as clearly as I saw them then, as I stood
at the tinsmith’s door in the High Street of Oakford&mdash;let
me see, how many years ago?</p>

<p>The child who looked the older, but was, as I afterwards
discovered, the younger of the two, was also the less pretty.
And yet she had a sweet little face, hair like spun gold, and
blue-grey eyes with dark lashes. She wore a grey frock of
some warm material, below which peeped her indoors dress
of blue. The outer coat had a quaint cape like a coachman’s,
which was relieved by a broad white crimped frill round her
throat. Her legs were cased in knitted gaiters of white
wool, and her hands in the most comical miniatures of gloves.
On her fairy head she wore a large bonnet of grey beaver,
with a frill inside. But it was her sister who shone on my
young eyes like a fairy vision. She looked too delicate, too
brilliant, too utterly lovely, for anywhere but fairyland.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
She ought to have been kept in tissue-paper, like the loveliest
of wax dolls. Her hair was the true flaxen, the very fairest
of the fair. The purity and vividness of the tints of red
and white in her face I have never seen equalled. Her eyes
were of speedwell blue, and looked as if they were meant to
be always more or less brimming with tears. To say the
truth, her face had not half the character which gave force
to that of the other little damsel, but a certain helplessness
about it gave it a peculiar charm. She was dressed exactly
like the other, with one exception&mdash;her bonnet was of white
beaver, and she became it like a queen.</p>

<p>At the tinsmith’s shop they stopped, and the old man-servant,
after unbuckling a strap which seemed to support
them in their saddle, lifted each little miss in turn to the
ground. Once on the pavement the little lady of the grey
beaver shook herself out, and proceeded to straighten the
disarranged overcoat of her companion, and then, taking her
by the hand, the two clambered up the step into the shop.
The tinsmith’s shop boasted of two seats, and on to one of
these she of the grey beaver with some difficulty climbed.
The eyes of the other were fast filling with tears, when from
her lofty perch the sister caught sight of the man-servant,
who stood in the doorway, and she beckoned him with a
wave of her tiny finger.</p>

<p>“Lift her up, if you please,” she said on his approach.
And the other child was placed on the other chair.</p>

<p>The shopman appeared to know them, and though he
smiled, he said very respectfully, “What articles can I show
you this morning, ladies?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p>

<p>The fairy-like creature in the white beaver, who had been
fumbling in her miniature glove, now timidly laid a farthing
on the counter, and then turning her back for very shyness
on the shopman, raised one small shoulder, and inclining her
head towards it, gave an appealing glance at her sister out of
the pale-blue eyes. That little lady, thus appealed to,
firmly placed another farthing on the board, and said in the
tiniest but most decided of voices,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“<span class="smcap">Two flat irons, if you please.</span>”<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Hereupon the shopman produced a drawer from below the
counter, and set it before them. What it contained I was
not tall enough to see, but out of it he took several flat irons
of triangular shape, and apparently made of pewter, or some
alloy of tin. These the grey beaver examined and tried upon
a corner of her cape, with inimitable gravity and importance.
At last she selected two, and keeping one for herself, gave
the other to her sister.</p>

<p>“Is it a nice one?” the little white-beavered lady inquired.</p>

<p>“Very nice.”</p>

<p>“Kite as nice as yours?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said the other firmly. And having
glanced at the counter to see that the farthings were both
duly deposited, she rolled abruptly over on her seat, and
scrambled off backwards, a manœuvre which the other child
accomplished with more difficulty. The coats and capes were
then put tidy as before, and the two went out of the shop
together, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Then the old man-servant lifted them into the Spanish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
saddle, and buckled the strap, and away they went up the
steep street, and over the brow of the hill, where trees and
palings began to show, the beaver bonnets nodding together
in consultation over the flat irons.</p></blockquote>

<p>The commission to paint this water-colour being
unfettered in every way, the artist felt herself at
liberty to create a colour scheme of her own&mdash;hence
the changes in the dresses, etc.; also to put an old
woman (after a Devonshire cottager) in place of
the shopman, and to make the shop a toyshop
instead of a tinsmith’s. The little girl ironing was
painted from a study of a Mr. Hennessy’s eldest
little daughter; the fair little maiden from Mr.
Briton Riviere’s eldest daughter.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Interesting not only as the earliest example here
of Mrs. Allingham’s landscape work, having been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
painted at Limpsfield, Surrey, in May 1876, and
as such full of promise of better things to come,
but as an instance of a preference for a complex
and very difficult effect, which the artist, on obtaining
greater experience, very wisely abandoned.
There is little doubt that she was tempted by the
glorious wealth of colouring which a low sun threw
upon the warm quarry side, the pine wood, and
the huge cumuli which banked them up&mdash;a magnificent
but a fleeting effect, which could only
be placed on record from very rapid notes. The
result could be successful only in the hands of a
practised adept, and it is not surprising, therefore,
that in those of an artist just embarking on her
career it was not entirely so. The difficulties of
the task may have afforded her a useful lesson,
for we have seen no further attempts on her part
at their repetition.</p>

<p>If the landscape foretells little concerning the
future of the artist, the figures standing on the brink
of the quarry, the elder with her arm placed lovingly
and protectingly round the neck of the younger,
whilst they watch the martins rejoicing in the warm
summer evening, are eminently suggestive of the
success which Mrs. Allingham was to achieve in
the addition of figures to landscape composition.

<p>Contemporary criticism is not, as a rule, palatable
to an artist, for amongst the varied views
which the art critics bring to their task there are
always to be found some that are not seen from
the same standpoint as his. Besides, for some
occult reason, the balance always trends in the
direction of fault-finding rather than praise, probably
because it is so much the easier, for work
always has and will have imperfections that are not
difficult to distinguish. But in the case of the
water-colour before us the critics’ chorus must
have been very exhilarating to the young artist,
especially as, at the time of its exhibition at the
Royal Water-Colour Society, in the spring of 1877,
she was by no means in good health. The <i>Spectator</i>,
for instance, wrote that artists would have to look
to their laurels when ladies began to paint in a
manner little inferior to Walker. The <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
gave it the exceptional length of a column, considering
it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>“one of the few pictures by which

the exhibition in question would be remembered.”
Tom Taylor in the <i>Times</i> wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of all the newly associated figure painters there is none
whose work has more of the rare quality that inspires interest
than Mrs. Allingham. She has only two drawings here, a
pretty little child’s head and a large and exquisitely finished
composition, “The Old Men’s Gardens, Chelsea Hospital,”
where some hundred and forty little garden plots are parcelled
out among as many of the old pensioners, each of whom is
free to follow his own fancies in his gardening.</p>

<p>In the hush of a calm summer evening, two graceful girls
in white dresses accept a nosegay from one of the veterans,
a Guardsman of the <i>vieille cour</i>, by his look and bearing.
All around are plots of sweet, bright flowers all aglow with
variegated petals. Here and there under the shade of the
old trees sit restful groups of the old veterans, with children
about them; one little fellow reverentially lifts and examines
one of the medals on a war-worn breast. Behind, the
thickly-clothed fronds of a drooping ash spread to the
declining sun, and the level roofs of the old Hospital rise
ruddy against the warm and cloudless sky. No praise can
be too high for the exquisiteness with which the flowers are
drawn, coloured, and combined, or for the skill with which
they are blended into an artistic whole with the suggestive
and graceful group in the foreground. The drawing deserves
to take its place as a pendant of Walker’s “Haven of Rest.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is curious that all the critics seem to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
misinterpreted the main meaning of the artist’s
motive, namely, that whilst the Pensioners naturally,
in the first place, wish to sell their posies,
they are always ready to give them to those who
cannot afford to buy. The well-to-do ladies are
purchasing the flowers, the little group of mother,
boy, and baby, on the right, who can ill afford to
buy, are having a posy graciously offered to them.
The drawing represented Mrs. Allingham at the
Jubilee Exhibition in Manchester, 1887, and the
Loan Water-Colour Exhibition at the Guildhall,
London, in 1896. It is of the large size, for this
artist’s work, of 25 inches by 15 inches.</p>

<p>How considerable and rapid an advance now
took place in Mrs. Allingham’s powers may be seen
from the two drawings which are dated two years
later, namely, in 1879. In figure draftsmanship there
is no comparison between the timid and haltingly
painted children of “The Sand-Martins’ Haunt”
and the seated baby in “The Clothes-Line.” In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the first the capacity to draw was no doubt present,
but the power to express it through the medium of
water-colour was as yet unacquired. But after two
years’ study, knowledge is present in its fulness, and
from now onwards the only changes in Mrs. Allingham’s
work are a greater precision, breadth, facility
of handling, and harmony of colour. The figure of
the woman still smacks somewhat too much of the
studio, and she is a lady-like model,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> certainly not
the type one would expect to see hanging out the
washing of such a clearly limited and humble
wardrobe as in this case. The figure again detaches
itself too much from the rest of the picture, and
Mrs. Allingham, we are sure, would now never
introduce such a jarring note as the scarlet
and primrose handkerchief, to which Mr. Ruskin
objected at the time it was painted. The blanket,
clothes-line, clothes-basket, and other accessories
are painted with a minuteness which was an admirable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
prelude to the breadth that was to follow; but
are singularly constrained in comparison with the
yellow gorse bushes, most difficult of any shrubs to
limn, but which here are noteworthy for unusual
easiness of touch. Even with these qualifications
the picture is a delightful one, replete with grace
and beauty, and complete in its portrayal of the
little incident of the baby, a less robust little body
than Mrs. Allingham would now paint, capturing
as many of the clothes-pegs that her mother needs
as her small fingers and arms can embrace.</p>

<p>This, like “The Young Customers,” was founded
on previous work, namely, a black-and-white drawing
made for the <i>Graphic</i>, as an illustration to Mrs.
Oliphant’s <i>Innocent</i>. But in the story the patient
dies from an over-dose administered in mistake by
Innocent, who is nursing her. Some years afterwards
the poisoning comes to light, and Innocent
is tried and acquitted. Mrs. Allingham would never
have voluntarily repeated such a subject as this,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and her temperament is shown in her having
utilised the material for one in which refreshing
sleep promises a speedy recovery.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Sir F. Wigan.</i><br />

<p>Painted at Broadstairs, and containing portraits
of Mrs. Allingham’s children. Noticeable as being
one of a few drawings where the artist has introduced
animals of any size into her compositions,
but showing that, had she minded, she might have
animated her landscapes with them with as conspicuous
success as she has with her human figures.
Perhaps an incident which happened whilst this
picture was being painted deterred her. Billy
being tied up so as to keep him in somewhat the
same position, managed to gnaw through his rope,
and, irate at his detention, he made for the lady to
whom he thought his captivity was due, and nearly
upset her, paintbox, and picture. The exhibition
of this and kindred portraits of her children under
such titles as “The Young Artist” and “The
Donkey Ride,” led to strangers wishing for portraits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
of their offspring under similar winsome
conditions. But Mrs. Allingham never cared for
the restraint imposed by portrait painting, and the
few that she did in this manner were undertaken
more from friendship than from pleasure.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that Mrs. Allingham has
treated her public to drawings with low horizons
or sunsets, perhaps for the reason that little of her
life has been spent away in the flatter counties,
where the latter are so noticeable and full of charm
and beauty. This water-colour, the first large
landscape that the artist exhibited, was painted
from studies made in the Isle of Thanet, whilst
staying at Broadstairs.</p>

<p>This is practically the last of the water-colours
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
which were the outcome of earlier pictures executed
in black and white for the illustration of books.</p>

<p>The story is from <i>Deborah’s Drawer</i>, by Eleanor
Grace O’Reilly, for which, as Helen Paterson, our
artist had made nine drawings in 1870, at a time
when she was so inexperienced in drawing on the
wood that in more than one instance her monogram
appears turned the wrong way. Mr. Bell, the
publisher of the book, subsequently commissioned
her to make a companion water-colour to “The
Young Customers,” and suggested one of the illustrations
called “Ralph’s Girls” as the basis for a
subject.</p>

<p>The little black-robed girls were twins, whose
mother had recently died, and who had been placed
under the care of a grandmother, who forgot their
youth and spirits. They were imaginative children,
and indulged in delightfully original games. One
(that of personating a sportsman named Jenkins
and a dog called Tubbs, who together went partridge-shooting
through a big field of cabbages
laden with dew) they had just been taking part in.
Tired out with it, they decided to be themselves
again, and to mount to the hayloft and play
another favourite game, that of “remembering.”
This meant taking them back over their short lives,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
which ended up with their most recent remembrance,
their mother’s death. Whilst talking over
this they are summoned from their retreat, and
have to appear with their black dresses soaked with
the dew from the cabbages, and with hay adhering
everywhere to their deep crape trimmings. Hence
much penance!</p>

have evidence that Mrs. Allingham might, had she
been so minded, have succeeded with animals as
well as she has with human figures and landscape.
A little play is being enacted; the dog, evidently
a rival of the inhabitants of the hutch, has to be
kept at a distance while their feeding is going on,
lest his jealousy might find an outlet in an onslaught
upon them.

<p>This drawing was executed just at the turning
of the ways, when London was to be exchanged for
country life, and studio for out-of-door painting.
What an increased power came about through the
change will be seen by a comparison between this
“Donkey Ride” and the “Children’s Tea” (<a href="#Plate_23">Plate 23</a>).
Only two years separate them in date; but whilst
in the one we have timidity and hesitancy, in the
other the end is practically assured. In “The
Donkey Ride” we have evidences of experiments,
especially in the direction of finicking stippling (all
over the sea and sky) and of the use of body-colour
(in the baby’s bonnet and the flowers), which were
abandoned later on, to the artist’s exceeding great
benefit. What we expect to find, and do find, is
the pure sentiment, and the dainty freshness, which
is never absent from the earliest efforts onwards.</p>

<p>The scene is the cliffs near Broadstairs, Mrs.
Allingham’s two eldest children occupying the
panniers.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="large">THE ARTIST’S SURREY HOME</span></h2>

<p>There are few fairer counties in England than
Surrey, and of Surrey the fairest portion is admittedly
the extreme south-western edge which skirts
Sussex to the south and Hampshire to the west.
Travellers from London to Portsmouth by the
London and South-Western Railway on leaving
Guildford pass through the middle of the right
angle which this corner makes, and cut the corner
two miles beyond Haslemere almost exactly at the
point where the three counties meet. As the steep
rise of nearly 300 feet which has to be surmounted
in the six miles which divide Witley from Haslemere
is being negotiated by the train, the most
unobservant passenger must be struck by the
singularly beautiful wooded character of the
country on either side, and by the far-extended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
view which is unfolded as the eye looks southward
over the Weald of Sussex.</p>

<p>It was to Sandhills, near Witley, that Mrs.
Allingham came to live in 1881 with her growing
family, and it was in this corner of Surrey that she
found ample material for almost all her work during
the next few years; and it is there that she has
returned at intervals for the majority of those
cottage subjects which the public has called for,
ever since her first portrayal of them shortly after
her commencement of landscape painting in these
parts.</p>

<p>Witley consists of groups of irregularly-dotted-about
houses, which hardly constitute a village, and
would perhaps be better designated by the proper
name&mdash;Witley Street. A few years ago every one
of the houses counted their ages by centuries, and
were fitting companions of the ancient oaks and
elms that shaded them. Some few are left, but
the majority are gone, many so long before the
term of their natural existence had run that it was
a troublesome piece of work to destroy them.
There is also an old “Domesday Book” Church.
Drawings of almost all of the cottages, from the
hand of Mrs. Allingham, are in existence somewhere
or other, but she never seems to have painted this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
or other churches, having apparently little liking
for them, as had Birket Foster. In the present
case the omission to do so arose from the fact that
in painting it she would have formed one of the
occupants of half-a-dozen outspread white umbrellas,
all taking a stiffly-composed subject from
the same point of view.</p>

<p>Sandhills, where our artist lived, is on the
Haslemere side of Witley, on a sloping common of
heather and gorse, topped with fir trees. From
thence the view, looking southwards, extends far
and wide over the Weald of Surrey and Sussex,
Hindhead, a mountain-like hill rising behind, and
Blackdown, a spur stretching out on to the Sussex
Valley to the right. In the distance are to be seen
the rising grounds near Midhurst and Petworth,
Chanctonbury Ring with its tuft of trees, called
locally “The Squire’s Hunting Cap,” and on a
clear day the downs as far as Brighton and Lewes.</p>

<p>It is indeed a healthy and bracing spot, and one
calculated to induce a painter to energetic work,
and a delight in doing it. Subjects lay close at
hand, the Sandhills garden furnishing many a one.
“Master Hardy’s,” a charming cottage tenanted by
a charming old man, was within a stone’s throw,
and received attention inside and out. Of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Hindhead Road, which passes south-west, a single
Exhibition, that of 1886, contained six subjects, all
of them wayside cottages, but no one of which,
when the Exhibition opened, was as depicted,
having in that short time been “done up” by local
builders at the bidding of Philistine owners.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood round is, or perhaps we
should say was, also prolific in subjects&mdash;Haslemere,
four miles south-west, with its pleasant wide
old streets, and with fields tilted up at the end of
it, furnished its Fish-Shop, and other thoroughly
English village scenes.</p>

<p>Some two miles south of Haslemere was Aldworth,
Lord Tennyson’s house, a mile over the
Sussex border, although always spoken of as his
“Surrey” residence. To Mrs. Allingham’s work
there we shall have occasion to refer later on.</p>

<p>The varied summits of Hindhead (painted a
century earlier by Turner and Rowlandson, and at
that time adorned with a gibbet for the benefit
of the highwaymen who infested the Portsmouth
Road, which passes over it), in one place bare
moor, in another crested with fir trees, lay some
distance northward of Haslemere; but our artist
did not often depict them, although they presented
themselves under many a charming aspect, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
never more glorious than at sunset in their robes
of violet and gold. A thoroughly characteristic
view of them is however given in the Lord Chief
Justice’s drawing (<a href="#Plate_19">Plate 19</a>).</p>

<p>To the southward of Sandhills stretches, as we
have said, the Weald. To this district Mrs.
Allingham made frequent excursions, not only for
cottages, which she found at Hambledon, Chiddingfold,
and Wisborough, but for spring and autumn
subjects in the oak woods and copses which to this
day probably bear much the same aspect as did the
ancient Forest of Anderida (whose site they occupy)
in the time of the Heptarchy.</p>

<p>Oak is the tree of the wealden clay on the lower
levels, but elms grow to a grand size on the higher
ground, where ashes are also numerous. Spanish
chestnuts “encamp in state” on certain slopes, and
many of the hills are “fringed and pillared” with
pines. The interminable hazel copses are interspersed
with long labyrinthine paths, the intricacies
of which are only known to the countryside folk.
Not so long ago the cutting down at intervals of
the young wood for the purposes of hop poles,
hurdles, and kindling, brought in a handsome
revenue to the owners; but of late years wire has
taken the place of wood for the two first of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
objects, and the labourers prefer dear coal to wood,
even as a gift, for it does not entail cutting up.
As railway rates to bring it to the metropolis
are prohibitive, it is hard to say what the consequences
will be in a few years, but the probabilities
actually point to a return to the primitive conditions
which existed in the Saxon times to which
we have referred.</p>

<p>In the spring the country round is decked with
primroses, bluebells, and cowslips in the woods,
hedgerows, and fields, being fortunately outside
the range of the marauders from London; and
it is indeed pleasurable to ramble from copse to
field, and back again. But in autumn and winter
the deep clay soil makes it heavy travelling in
the deep-cut roads and lanes, cumbered with the
redolent decay of the leafage from the trees.</p>

<p>The cottars were, when the majority of these
drawings were made, rural and old-fashioned, and
many had lived hereabouts through numerous
generations. A quiet, taciturn folk, contented
with moderate comforts, on good terms with their
wealthier neighbours, not often feeling the pinch
of poverty.</p>

<p>Maybe all are not so good-looking as Mrs.
Allingham has depicted them, but they vary much,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
some being flaxen Saxons, others as dark complexioned
as gipsies.</p>

<p>As will be seen, they have a taste and enjoyment
for colour, if not for change, in the gardens
with which their cottages are fairly well supplied.
These are bright at one or other season of the year
with snowdrop, crocus, and daffodil, lilac, sweetwilliam,
and pink, sunflower, Michaelmas daisy,
and chrysanthemum.</p>

<p>The following drawings have been selected as
illustrating the neighbourhood of Mrs. Allingham’s
home at Sandhills:&mdash;</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. H. W. Birks.</i><br />

Painted 1887.</span></h3>

<p>It is very seldom that we encounter a drawing
of Mrs. Allingham that deals with Nature in
winter’s garb. In this respect she differs from
Birket Foster, who rightly considered that trees
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
were oftentimes as beautiful in their nude as in
their clothed array. Especially did he delight in
the towering framework of the elm, which he regarded
as the most typical of English trees.</p>

<p>Nor is it often that we see Mrs. Allingham
afield so early in the spring as in this lane scene,
where the elms are clothed only in their “ruddy
hearted blossom flakes.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Perhaps this absence is
due to prudential reasons, to avoid the rheumatism
which appears to be the only ailment which the
landscapist runs against in his healthy outdoor
profession.</p>

<p>Those who have seen the woods of Surrey and
Sussex at this time of year know what a lovely
colour they assume in the budding stage, a colour
that makes the view over the Weald from such
a vantage-ground as Blackdown a sea of ravishing
violet hues, almost equalling that of the oak forests
as seen in February from the Terrace at Pau, which
stretch away to the snow-clad range of the Pyrenees&mdash;perhaps
the most delicately perfect view in
Europe. But the day selected for this sketch was
evidently a warm one for the time of year, or we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
should not see that unusual occurrence, an open
bedroom window in a labourer’s cottage.</p>

<p>The flowering whin is no index to the season,
for we know the old adage&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the whin’s in bloom, my love’s in tune.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the catkins on the hazel, and the primroses on
the banks, must place it round that elastic date,
Eastertide.</p>

<p>These wayside primroses remind one of a strongly
expressed opinion of Mrs. Allingham’s, that wayside
flowers should never be gathered, but left for
the enjoyment of the passers-by&mdash;a liberal one,
which was first instilled into her by her husband,
who wrote verses upon it, from which I cull the
following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Pluck not the wayside flower,<br /></span>

<h3>19. HINDHEAD FROM WITLEY COMMON<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of the Lord Chief Justice
of England.</i><br />

Painted 1888.</span></h3>

<p>When this drawing appeared in the Exhibition
of 1889 there were some who called in question
the truthfulness of the colour of distant Hindhead,
affirming that it was too blue. But when the air
comes up in August from the southward, laden
with a salty moisture, and the shadows are cast by
hurrying clouds over the distance, it is altogether
and exactly of the hue set down here. Had the
effect been incorrect it would hardly have been
acquired by so critical a collector as Lord Alverstone,
nor would it have been hung in his Surrey
home, where it invites daily comparison with Nature
under similar aspects. The drawing was painted on
the spot, from just behind the artist’s house, and
is one of the few instances where she has added to
the charm of her work by a sky of some intricacy.
In her cottage and other drawings, where buildings
or other landscape objects are of primary importance,
she has felt that the simpler the treatment of
the sky the better, and with good reason. Here,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
where a large expanse calls for interesting forms
to cover it, she has shown her complete ability to
introduce them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham’s house at Sandhills was below
the foreground slope, to the right of the cottages
whose roofs rise from the ling. The highest point
of Hindhead seen here is Hurt Hill, some nine
hundred feet above sea-level, a name which Mr.
Allingham always held to be a corruption of
Whort Hill, from the whortleberries with which
its slopes are covered, and which in these, as in
other parts are called “wurts.”</p>

<p>This drawing was in The Fine Art Society’s
Exhibition in 1886, the catalogue stating that the
cottage had disappeared in the spring of 1885. It
was pulled down by its owner to be replaced
by buildings whose monotonous symmetry, to his
eye no doubt, appeared in better taste. The
cottage was still far from the natural term of its
existence, as evidenced by the troublesome piece
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of work it was to dislocate the sound, firm old
oaken beams of which its framework was built up.
Mr. Birket Foster, who equally with Mrs. Allingham
mourned its disappearance, regretted that he
could not rebuild it in his own grounds.</p>

<p>The blackening elms, and the ripe bracken carried
home by the cottar, show that the time when this
picturesque dwelling was painted was late summer,
probably that of 1884. Mrs. Allingham was clearly
then not of Ruskin’s opinion concerning the wrongness
of painting trees in full leaf, for she found the
blue-black of the trees a harmonious background
to her red and russet roof.</p>

<p>The work throughout shows a loving fidelity
to Nature, as if the artist had felt that she was
looking upon the likeness of an old friend for the
last time, and wished to perpetuate every lineament
and feature.</p>

Grays Wood Common, which lies to the south of
the railway, and the spur of blue hill seen in the

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. A. E. Cumberbatch.</i><br />

Painted 1887.</span></h3>

<p>One can well understand the local builder in his
daily round past this picturesque little tenement
casting longing eyes upon its uneven roof, its
diamond-paned lattices, its projecting shop front,
and its spoutless eaves, which allowed the damp
to rise up from the foundations and the green
lichen to grow upon its walls, and that he rested
not until he had set hands upon it, and taken one
more old-world feature from the main thoroughfare
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
at Haslemere. Such was actually the case here,
for the shop has long ago disappeared, but it was
not until, much to its owner’s regret, interference
was necessary. Were it not that it indeed was the
fish-shop of Haslemere, it might well have served
for the toyshop in which the scene of “The Young
Customers” was laid. In the days when this was
painted the accommodation provided was probably
sufficient for the intermittent supply of an inland
village, for Haslemere was not, until the last few
years, a country resort for those who seek fine air
and beautiful scenery, and can afford to pay a high
price for it.

<span class="large">THE INFLUENCE OF WITLEY</span></h2>

<p>It will be readily understood that such a beneficial
change in her life surroundings as that from Trafalgar
Square, Chelsea, to Sandhills, Witley, was
not without its effect upon Mrs. Allingham’s Art.
Hitherto her work had, by the exigencies of fortune,
lain almost wholly and entirely in the direction of
the figure. It was studio work, done for the most
part under pressure of time, the selection of subject
being none of hers, and therefore oftentimes
altogether unsympathetic. Finding herself now
in the presence of Nature of a kind that appealed
to her, and which she could appreciate untrammelled
by any conditions, it is not surprising that&mdash;unwittingly,
no doubt, at first&mdash;the preference was given
to that side of Art which presented itself under so
much more favourable conditions.</p>

<p>The delight of painting <i>en plein air</i> had first
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
been tasted at Shere in the spring and summer of
1878, where she was passionately happy in watching
the changes and developments of the seasons, being
in the fields, lanes, and copses all day and every
day.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Almost as full a feast had followed at Haslemere
in 1880. When these were succeeded by a
permanent residence in front of Nature, studio work
became more and more trying and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>To most people of an artistic temperament the
abandonment of the figure for landscape would
never have been the subject of a moment’s consideration,
for it would have appeared to them the
desertion of a higher for a lower grade of Art.
But from the time of her arrival in the country
there seems to have never been any doubt in Mrs.
Allingham’s mind as to the direction which her
Art should take. The pleasure to which we have
referred of sitting down in the open air before
Nature, whose aspects and moods she could select
at her own will, and at her own time, was infinitely
preferable to the toil and trouble of either illustrating
the ideas of others, or building up scenes, oftentimes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
improbable ones, of her own creation. From
this time onwards, then, we find her drifting away
from the figure, but not altogether, or at once, for
as her family grew up, scenes in her house life
passed across her view which she enjoyed to place
on record, and for which the world thanks her:
scenes of infant life in the nursery, such as “Pat-a-cake”
and “The Children’s Tea”; in the schoolroom,
such as “Lessons”; and out of school hours,
such as “Bubbles” and “The Children’s Maypole.”
In one and all of these it is her own family who
are the chief actors.</p>

<p>The portrayal of her children in heads of a larger
size than her usual work was at this time seen by
friends and others, who pressed upon her commissions
for effigies of their own little ones, a branch
of work which promptly drew down upon her the
disapproval of Ruskin, who wrote: “I am indeed
sorrowfully compelled to express my regret that
she should have spent unavailing pains in finishing
single heads, which are at the best uninteresting
miniatures, instead of fulfilling her true gift, and
doing what the Lord made her for in representing
the gesture, character, and humour of charming
children in country landscapes.”</p>

<p>But this change naturally did not pass over her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
work all at once, or even in a single year. Mrs.
Allingham’s presentations of the countryside commenced
in earnest shortly after her settling down at
Witley in 1881; but as will be seen by the dates of
the pictures which illustrate this chapter, the figure
as the dominant feature continues for another six
years; in fact, during the whole of her seven and
a half years at Witley we find it now and again,
and do not part with it as such until 1890. Since
then hardly a single example has come from her
brush. Mrs. Allingham gives as her reason for
the change that she came to the conclusion that
she could put as much interest into a figure two
or three inches high as in one three times as large,
and that she could paint it better; for in painting
large figures out of doors it was always a difficulty
in making them look anything else than they were,
namely, “posing models.”</p>

<p>But if the figure ceases to occupy the foremost
position, it is still there, and is always present
to add a charming vitality to all that she does.
To people a landscape with figures, of captivating
mien, each taking its proper position, and each
adding to the interest of the whole, is a gift which
is the property of but few landscapists. It is
indeed a gift, for we have before us the example
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
of the greatest landscapist of all, who the more he
strove the more he failed. But it is a gift which
we believe many more might obtain by strenuous
endeavour. It is always a matter of surprise to
the ignorant public how it comes to pass that an
artist who can draw nature admirably should never
attempt to learn the draftsmanship of the human
figure, by the omission of which from his work he
deprives it of half its interest and value. He often
goes a step further, and shows not his inability but
his indolence by producing picture after picture,
upon the face of which no single instance occurs
of the introduction of man, beast, or bird, save
and except a single unpretentious creature of the
lowest grade of the feathered creation; this, however,
he will draw sufficiently well to prove that
he could, an he would, double the interest in his
landscapes. To the outsider this appears incomprehensible
in the person of those who apparently
are thorough artists, ardent in their profession.
One meets such an one at table, and even between
the courses he cannot refrain from taking out his
pencil and covering the menu with his scribblings;
but the same man appears before Nature without a
note-book, in which he might be storing so many
jottings, which would be of untold value to his work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham’s case has been the entire contrary
to this; she has, I will not say toiled, for the
garnering must be a pleasure, but stored, many a
time and oft, for future use, a mass of valuable
material, so that she is never at a loss for the right
adjunct to fit the right place. Her so doing was,
in the first instance, due entirely to her husband.
He said, truly, that the introduction of animals
and birds, in fact, any form of life, gave scale and
interest to a picture, and he urged her to begin
making studies from the first. There is not the
slightest doubt that she owed very much to him
that habit of thinking out fitting figures, as she
has always tried, and with exceptional success, as
accessories to every landscape.</p>

<p>Her sketch-books, consequently, are full not
only of men, women, and children, and their immediate
belongings, but of most of the animal life
which follows in their train. I say “most,” because
for some reason, which I have not elicited from her,
she has preferences. Horses, cattle, and sheep she
will have but little of, only occasionally introducing
them in distant hay or harvest fields. The only
instances of anything akin to either in this book
are the animals in “The Goat Carriage,” and “The
Donkey Ride.” Nor will she have much to say to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
dogs, but for cats she has a great fondness, and
they animate a large number of her scenes. Fowls,
pigeons, and the like she paints to the life, and
she apparently is thoroughly acquainted with their
habits; but other winged creatures, save an occasional
robin, she avoids. Rabbits, wild and tame,
she often introduces.</p>

<p>Her pictures being always typical of repose, she
avoids much motion in her figures. Her children
even, seldom indulge in violent action, unlike those
of Birket Foster, who run races down hill, use the
skipping-rope, fly kites, and urge the horses in the
lane out of their accustomed foots-pace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As typical examples of the drawings made in the
early days at Witley, and whilst the figure was the
main object, we have selected the following:&mdash;</p>

<div id="Plate_23" class="figcenter">
<p class="caption">23. THE CHILDREN’S TEA</p>
<img src="images/plate_23.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<h3>23. THE CHILDREN’S TEA<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. W. Hollins.</i><br />

Painted 1882.</span></h3>

<p>This is the most important, and, to my mind, the
most delightful of any of Mrs. Allingham’s creations;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
quite individual, and quite unlike the work of
any one else. Not only is the subject a charming
one, but the actors in it all hold one’s attention.
It is certainly destined in the future to hold a high
place among the examples of English water-colour
art.</p>

<p>The scene is laid in Mrs. Allingham’s dining-room
at Sandhills, Witley, and contains portraits
of her children. The incidents are slight but
original. The mother is handing a cup of tea, but
no one notices it, for the eldest girl’s attention is
taken up with the old cat lapping its milk, her
younger sister, with her back to the window, is
occupied in feeding her doll, propped up against a
cup, from a large bowl of bread and milk, and
the two other children are attracted to a sulphur
butterfly which has just alighted on a glass of lilies
of the valley. The <i>etceteras</i> are painted as beautifully
as the bigger objects; note, for instance, the
bowl of daffodils on the old oak cupboard, the china
on the table, and even the buns and the preserves.
The whole is suffused with the warmth of a spring
afternoon, the season being ascertainable by the
budding trees outside, and the spring flowers inside.
Exception may be taken to the faces not being
more in shadow from a light which, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
reflected from the tablecloth, is apparently behind
them, and to the tablecloth being whiter than the
sky, which it would not be. The fact, as regards
the former, is that the faces were also lit from a
window behind the spectator, whilst the latter is a
permissible licence.</p>

<h3>24. THE STILE<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. Alfred Shuttleworth.</i><br />

Painted 1883.</span></h3>

<p>The effort of negotiating a country stile, such
as the one here depicted, which has no aids in
the way of subsidiary steps, always induces a desire
to rest by the way. Especially is this the case
when a well-worn top affords a substantial seat.
Time is evidently of little importance to the two
sisters, for they have lingered in the hazel copse
gathering hyacinths and primroses. Besides, the
little one has asserted her right to a meal, and that
would of itself be a sufficient excuse for lingering
on the journey. The dog seems of the same way
of thinking, and is evidently eagerly weighing the
chances as to how much of the slice of bread and
butter will fall to its share.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>The drawing is a rich piece of colouring, but
the hedgerow bank, with its profusion and variety
of flowers, shows just that lack of a restraining
hand which is so evident in Mrs. Allingham’s
fully-matured work. It was painted entirely in the
open air, close to Sandhills, and the model who sat
for the little child is now the artist’s housemaid.</p>

<h3>25. “PAT-A-CAKE”<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Sir F. Wigan, Bt.</i><br />

Painted 1884.</span></h3>

<p>This drawing, although painted later than “The
Children’s Tea,” would seem to be the prelude to
a set in which practically the same figures take a
part.</p>

<p>The motive here, as in all Mrs. Allingham’s
subjects, is of the simplest kind. The young girl
reads from nursery rhymes that time-honoured one
of “Pat-a-cake, Pat-a-cake, Baker’s Man.” It is
apparently her younger brother’s first introduction
to the bye-play of patting, which should accompany
its recitation, for the child regards the performance
with some doubt, and has to be trained by the
nurse as to how its hands should be manœuvred.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<p>The drawing is full of details, such as the workbox,
scissors, thimble, primroses, and anemones in
the bowl, the china in the cupboard, and the
coloured engraving on the wall, which, as we have
seen in the case of other painters who have practised
it, opens up in fuller maturity a power of
painting which is never possible to those who have
neglected such an education.</p>

<p>The relations between the teacher and the
taught appear to be somewhat strained this summer
morning, for the little girl in pink is evidently at
fault with her lessons, and the boy, while presumably
figuring up a sum on his slate, has his eyes
and ears open for a break in the silence which
fills the room for the moment. However, in a
short time it will be halcyon weather for all the
actors, for the sun is streaming in at the window,
the roses show that it is high summer, and a day
on which the sternest teacher could not condemn
the most intractable child to lengthy indoor
imprisonment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>This drawing is of the same importance as
regards size as “The Children’s Tea,” and is full
of charm in every part.</p>

<p>Lessons are over, a stool has been brought from
the schoolroom, the kitchen has been invaded, and
the dish of soapsuds having been placed upon it
the fun has begun. Who, that has enjoyed it, will
forget the acrid taste of the long new churchwarden
(where do the children of the present day find such
pipes if they ever condescend to the fascinating
game of bubble-blowing?) that one naturally
sucked away at long before the watery compound
was ready, the still more pungent taste of the household
soap, the delight of seeing the first iridescent
globe detach itself from the pipe and float upwards
on the still air, or of raising a hundred globules by
blowing directly into the basin, as the smocked
youngster is doing here. Such joys countervailed
the smarts which befell one’s eyes when the burst
bubble scattered its fragments into them, or when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
the suds came to an end, not through their dissipation
into air, but over one’s clothes.</p>

<p>The family of young children that was now
growing up round our artist naturally necessitated
the summer holiday assuming a visit to the seaside,
and much of Mrs. Allingham’s time was, no doubt,
spent on the shore in their company. It is little
matter for surprise that this pleasure was combined
with that of welding them into pictures; and, if
an excuse must be made for Mrs. Allingham oftentimes
robing her little girls in pink, it is to be found
in the fact that the models were almost invariably
her own children, who were so attired. It certainly
will not be one of the least agreeable incidents for
those who saunter over the illustrations of this
volume to distinguish them and trace their growth
from the cradle onwards, until they pass out of the
stage of child models.</p>

<p>This drawing was painted on the shore at
Sandown, Isle of Wight, where the detritus of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Culver chalk cliffs afforded, in combination with
the sand, splendid material for the early achievements
in architecture and estate planning which
used to yield so healthy an occupation to
youngsters.</p>

<p>It was a hazardous task to attempt success with
such a variety of tones of white as here presented
themselves, but the result is entirely satisfactory.
In fact the drawing shows how readily and with
what success the painter took up another phase of
outdoor work, not easy of accomplishment. In
those collections which include these seashore
subjects they single themselves out from all their
neighbours by the aptitude with which figures and
a limpid sea are painted in sunshine. This, again,
is no doubt due to their having been entirely out-of-doors
work.</p>

<p>This important drawing, in which the figure is
on a large scale, makes one regret that Mrs.
Allingham abandoned her portraiture, for a more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
captivating life study it is hard to imagine.
Flattery apart, one may say that Frederick Walker
never drew a more ideal figure or conceived a more
charming colour scheme. The only feature which
would perhaps have been omitted from a later work
is that of the foxgloves in the corner, which appears
to be rather an artificial introduction. The note
of the little child behind the gate is charming. It
is evidently not allowed to wander in the field,
although the well-worn path shows that here is
the main road to the cottage, and it feels that a
joy is denied it not to be allowed to participate in
the ceremony of gathering in of the family washing,
as it was in younger days when the clothes were
hung out.</p>

<p>This, at the time it was painted, was the only
Post Office of which Bowler’s Green, near Haslemere,
boasted, and from its appearance it might well
have served during the reigns of several of Her
Majesty’s predecessors. It speaks much for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
absence of ill-disposed persons in the neighbourhood
that letters were for so long entrusted to its
care, as it seems far removed from the days of the
scarlet funnel which probably now replaces it. I
opine that the young gentleman whom we saw a
short while ago engaged in bubble-blowing has
been entrusted here with the posting of a letter.</p>

<p>May Day still lingers in some parts of the
country, for only last year in an out-of-the-way
lane in Northamptonshire the writer encountered a
band of children decked in flowers, and their best
frocks and ribbons, singing an old May ditty. But
lovers have long ago ceased to plant trees before
their mistresses’ doors, and to dance with them
afterwards round the maypole on the village green,
which we too are old enough to remember in
Leicestershire. The ceremony that Mrs. Allingham’s
children are taking a part in was doubtless
the recognition by a poet of his illustrious predecessor
Spenser’s exhortation:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>When Mrs. Allingham finally, I will not say
determined to cut herself away from figure painting,
but by the influence of her surroundings
drifted away from it, she did not, as so many do,
become the delineator of a single phase of landscape
art. Her journeyings in search of subjects
for some years were neither many nor extensive,
for a paintress with a family growing up around
her has not the same opportunities as a painter.
He can leave his incumbrances in charge of his
wife, and his work will probably benefit by an
occasional flitting from home surroundings. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
a mother’s work would not thrive away from her
children even if absence was possible, which it
probably was not in Mrs. Allingham’s case. Hence
we find that the ground she has covered has been
almost entirely confined to what are termed the
Home Counties, with an occasional diversion to the
Isle of Wight, Dorsetshire, Gloucestershire, and
Cheshire. In the Home Counties, Surrey and
Kent have furnished most of her material, the
former naturally being oftenest drawn upon during
her life at Witley, and the latter since she lived in
London, whither she returned in the year 1888.
This inability to roam about whither she chose
was doubtless helpful in compelling her to vary
her subjects, for she would of necessity have to
paint whatever came within her reach. But her
energy also had its share, for it enabled her to
search the whole countryside wherever she was,
and gather in a dozen suitable scenes where another
might only discover one.</p>

<p>As evidence of this we may instance the case of
the corner of Kent whither she has gone again
and again of late, and where in the present year
she has still been able to find ample material to her
liking. A visit to this somewhat out-of-the-way
spot, which lies in Kent in an almost identically
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
similar position to that which Witley does in Surrey,
namely, in the extreme south-west corner, shows
how she has found material everywhere. In the
mile that separates the station from the farmhouse
where she encamps, she shows a cottage that she
has painted from every side, a brick kiln that she
has her eye on, an old yew, and a clump of elms
that has been most serviceable. Arriving at the
farm-gate she points to the modest floral display in
front that has sufficed for “In the Farmhouse
Garden” (<a href="#Plate_2">Plate 2</a>), whilst over the way are the
buildings of “A Kentish Farmyard” (<a href="#Plate_58">Plate 58</a>).
Entering the house the visitor may not be much
impressed with the view from her sitting-room
window, but under the artist’s hands it has become
the silvern sheet of daisies reproduced in <a href="#Plate_38">Plate 38</a>.
“On the Pilgrims’ Way” (<a href="#Plate_41">Plate 41</a>) is a field or so
away, whilst a short walk up the downs behind the
house finds us in the presence of the originals of
<a href="#Plate_32">Plates 32</a> and <a href="#Plate_36">36</a>. A drive across the vale and
we have Crockham Hill, whence comes <a href="#Plate_40">Plate 40</a>,
and Ide Hill, <a href="#Plate_55">Plate 55</a>.</p>

<p>A ramble round these scenes, whilst a most
enjoyable matter to any one born to an appreciation
of the country, was in truth not the inspiration
that would be imagined to the writer of the text,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
for he had seen, for instance, the daintily conceived
water-colour of “Ox-eye Daisies” (<a href="#Plate_38">Plate 38</a>), painted
a year ago, and he arrived at the field to find this
year’s crop a failure, and on a day in which the
distant woods were hardly visible; the scene of the
“Foxgloves” had all the underwood grown up, and
only a stray spike suggestive of the glory of past
years; gipsy tramps on the road to “berrying”
(strawberry gathering) conjured up no visions of the
tenant of Mrs. Allingham’s “Spring on the Kentish
Downs,” but only a horrible thought of the strawberries
defiled by being picked by their hands.</p>

<p>This description of the variety of the artist’s
work within a single small area will show that it is
somewhat difficult to classify it for consideration.
However, one or two arrangements and rearrangements
of the drawings which illustrate these phases
of the artist’s output seem to bring them best into
the following divisions: woods, lanes, and fields;
cottages; and gardens. These we shall therefore
consider in this and the following chapters, dealing
here with the first of them.</p>

<p>Midway in her life at Witley, The Fine Art
Society induced Mrs. Allingham to undertake, as
the subject for an Exhibition, the portrayal of the
countryside under its four seasonal aspects of spring,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
summer, autumn, and winter. She completed her
task, and the result was shown in 1886 in an
Exhibition, but a glance at the catalogue shows in
which direction her preference lay; for whilst spring
and summer between them accounted for more than
fifty pictures, only seven answered for autumn, and
six, of which one half were interiors, illustrated
winter. These proportions may not perhaps have
represented the ratio of her affections, but of her
physical ability to portray each of the seasons.
Autumn leaves and tints no doubt appealed to her
artistic eye as much as spring or summer hues, but
for some reason, perhaps that of health, illustrations
were few and far between of the time of year</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare ruin’d choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In so selecting she differed from Mr. Ruskin,
who has laid it down that “a tree is never meant
to be drawn with all its leaves on, any more than a
day when its sun is at noon. One draws the day
in its morning or eventide, the tree in its spring
or autumn dress.” This naturally exaggerated
dictum is the contrary of Mrs. Allingham’s practice.
She almost invariably waits for the trees until they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
have completely donned their spring garb, and
leaves them ere they doff their summer dress.</p>

<p>The drawings of the woods, lanes, and fields
which Mrs. Allingham has selected for illustration
here comprise six of spring, three of summer,
and two of autumn, winter being unrepresented.
They are culled as to seven from Kent, three
from Surrey, and a single one from Hertfordshire.</p>

<p>Taking them in their seasonal order we may
discuss them as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>That the joy of spring is a never-failing subject
for poets, any one may see who turns over the
pages of the numerous compilations which now
treat of Nature. I doubt, however, whether they
receive a higher pleasure from it than does the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
townsman who can only walk afield at rare intervals,
and whose first visit to the country each year is
taken at Eastertide. He probably has no eye save
for the contrasts which he experiences to his daily
life, of scene, air, and vitality, but these will certainly
infect him with a healthier love of life than
is enjoyed by those who live amongst them and
see them come and go.</p>

<p>Fortunate is the man who can visit these Kentish
downs at a time when the breath of spring is
touching everything, when the eastern air makes
one appreciate the shelter that the hazel copses
fringing their sides afford, an appreciation which is
shared by the firs which hug their southern slopes.</p>

<p>It is very early spring in this drawing. The
highest trees show no sign of it save at their outermost
edges. Hazels alone, and they only in the
shelter, have shed their flowery tassels, and assumed
a leafage which is still immature in colour. The
sprawling trails of the traveller’s joy, which rioted
over everything last autumn, are still without any
trace of returning vitality.

<p>This little sequestered bridge would hardly seem
to be of sufficient importance to deserve a name,
nor for the matter of that the streamlet, the
Tigbourne, which runs beneath it, but on the
Hindhead slope streams of any size are scarce, and
therefore call for notice. Bridges resemble stiles
in being enforced loitering places, for whilst there
is no effort which compels a halt in crossing bridges,
as there is with stiles, there is the sense of mystery
which underlies them, and expectancy as to what
the water may contain. Especially is this so for
youth; and so here we have boy and girl who
pause on their way from bluebell gathering, whilst
the former makes belief of fishing with the thread
of twine which youngsters of his age always find
to hand in one or other of their pockets.

<p>We have elsewhere remarked on the rare occasions
on which Mrs. Allingham utilises sunlight
and shadow. Here, however, is one of them, and
one which shows that it is from no incapacity to
do so, for it is now introduced with a difficult
effect, namely, blue flowers under a low raking
light. The artist’s eye was doubtless attracted by
the unusual visitation of a bright warm sun on a
spring day, and determined to perpetuate it.</p>

<p>The wood in which the scene is laid is on the
Kentish Downs, where, as the distorted boughs
show, the winds are always in evidence.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of the two primaries, blue
and yellow, is always a happy one in nature, but
specially is it so when we have such a mass of
sapphire blue.</p>

<p>In a recent “One Man Exhibition” by that
refined artist Mr. Eyre Walker, there was a very
unusual drawing entitled “Beauty for Ashes.” The
entire foreground was occupied with a luxuriant
growth of purple willow loosestrife, intermixed
with the silvery white balls of down from seeding
nipplewort. Standing gaunt from this intermingling,
luxuriant crop, were the charred stems of burnt
fir trees, whilst the living mass of their fellows
formed an agreeable background. The subject
must have attracted many travellers on the South-Western
Railway as they passed Byfleet; it did so
in Mr. Walker’s case to the extent that he stayed
his journey and painted it.</p>

<p>In that case this beautiful display had, as the
title to the picture hints, arisen from the ashes of a
forest. A spark from a train had set fire to the
wood, and had apparently destroyed every living
thing in its course. But such is Nature that out of
death sprang life. So it has been with the coppice
here, and in the oakwood scene which preceded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
it. The cutting down and clearing of the wood has
brought sun, air, and rain to the soil, and as a consequence
have followed the</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the most impressive
flower-show that Nature presents to our
notice, namely, when, as May passes into June, the
whole countryside is decked with a bridal array of
pure white, should have taken hold of but few of
our poets.</p>

<p>Shakespeare, of course, recognised it in lines
which make one smile at the idea that they could
ever have been composed by a town-bred poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O what a life were this! How sweet, how lovely!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Than doth a rich embroidered canopy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kings that fear their subjects’ treachery.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another, in the person of Mrs. Allingham’s
husband, penned a sonnet upon it containing the
following happy description:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Cluster’d pearls upon a robe of green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broideries of white bloom.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The scene of this drawing is laid in the park at
Brocket Hall, to which reference is made in connection
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
with a subsequent illustration (<a href="#Plate_65">Plate 65</a>).
The park is full of ancient timber, one great oak on
the border of the two counties (Herts and Beds)
being mentioned in Doomsday Book, and another
going by the name of Queen Elizabeth’s oak, from
the tradition that the Princess was sitting under it
when the news reached her that she was Queen of
England.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The Hawthorn Valley runs for nearly
a mile from one of the park entrances towards the
more woodland part of the estate, and was formerly
used as a private race-course.</p>

<p>The artist has treated a very difficult subject
with success, as any one, especially an amateur,
who has tried to portray masses of hawthorn
blossom will readily admit. Any attempt to draw
the flowers and fill in the foliage is hopeless, and
it can only be done, as in this case, by erasure.
Hardly less difficult to accomplish are the delicate
fronds of the young bracken, unfolding upwards by
inches a day, which can only be treated suggestively.
In the original, which is on a somewhat large scale,
the middle distance is enlivened with browsing
rabbits, but the very considerable reduction of the
drawing has reduced these to a size which renders
them hardly distinguishable.

<p>Whilst no Exhibition passes nowadays which
has not one or more representations of the “blithe
populace” of daisies, the fashion has only come in of
late years. Even the Flemings, who were so partial
to the flowers of the field, seem to have considered it
beneath their notice&mdash;a strange occurrence, because
one can hardly turn over the pages of any missal of
a corresponding epoch without coming upon many
a faithful representation of the rose-encircled orb.</p>

<p>Chaucer extolled it</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above all the flow’res in the mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then love I most these flow’res white and red,<br /></span>

<p>And much content it gave him</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To see this flow’r against the sunne spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it upriseth early by the morrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blissful sight softeneth all my sorrow.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He recognised its name of “day’s eye,” because it
opens and closes its flower with the daylight, in
the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The daisie or els the eye of the daie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The emprise and the floure of floures alle.<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>In fact it was a favourite with English poets long
before it came under the notice of English painters.
Witness Milton’s well-known line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Meadows trim with daisies pied.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was not until the epoch of the pre-Raphaelite
brethren that the daisies which pie the meadows
seemed worthy of perpetuation, and it was reserved
to Frederick Walker, in his “Harbour of Refuge,”
to limn them on a lawn falling beneath the scythe.</p>

<p>The flower that Mrs. Allingham has painted
with so much skill&mdash;for it is a very difficult undertaking
to suggest a mass of daisies without too much
individualising&mdash;is not, of course, the field daisy
(<i>bellis perennis</i>) but the ox-eye, or moon daisy,
which is really a chrysanthemum (<i>chrysanthemum
leucanthemum</i>), a plant which seems to have increased
very much of late years, especially on railway
embankments, maybe because it has come into
vogue, and actually been advanced to a flower
worthy of gathering and using as a table decoration,
an honour that would never have been bestowed
on it a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>The drawing was made from the window of the
farmhouse in Kent, to which, as we have said,
Mrs. Allingham runs down at all seasons. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
evidently made on a glorious summer day, when
every flower had expanded to its utmost under the
delicious heat of a ripening sun. The bulbous
cloudlet which floats in front of the whiter strata,
and the blueness of the distant woods may augur
rain in the near future, but for the moment everything
appears to be in a serenely happy condition,
except perhaps the farmer, who would fain see a
crop in which there was less flower and more grass.</p>

<p>Foxgloves have appealed to Mrs. Allingham for
portrayal in more than one locality in England,
but never in greater luxuriance than on this Kentish
woodside, where their spikes overtop the sweet
little sixteen-year-old faggot-carrier. It happens
to be another instance of a magnificent crop springing
up the first year after a growth of saplings have
been cleared away, and not to be repeated even in
this year of grace (1903) when the newspapers have
been full of descriptions of the unwonted displays
of foxgloves everywhere, and have been taunting

the gardeners upon their poor results in comparison
with Nature’s.</p>

<p>It is perhaps a fallacy, or at least heresy, to assert
that English heather bears away the palm for beauty
over that of the country with which it is more
popularly associated. But many, I am sure, will
agree with me that nowhere in Scotland is any
stretch of heather to be found which can eclipse
in its magnificence of colour that which extends
for mile after mile over Surrey and Kentish commonland
in mid August. In the summer in which
this drawing was painted it was especially noticeable
as being in more perfect bloom than it had
been known to be for many seasons.</p>

<p>I was taken to task by Mrs. Allingham a while
ago for saying that her affections were not so set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
upon the delineation of harvesting as were those of
most landscapists, and she stated that she had
painted the sheafed fields again and again. But I
held to my assertion, and proof comes in this drawing
just handed to me. Not one artist in ten
would, I am certain, have sat down to his subject
on this side of the hedge, but would have been over
the stile, and made his foreground of the shorn field
and stacked sheaves, breaking their monotony of
form and colour by the waggon and its attendant
labourers. But Mrs. Allingham could not pass the
harvest of the hedge, and was satisfied with just a
peep of the corn through the gap formed by the
stile. It is not surprising, for who that is fond of
flowers could pass such a gladsome sight as the
display which Nature has so lavishly offered month
after month the summer through to those who
cared to notice it. In May the hedge was white
with hawthorn, in June gay with dog-roses and
white briar, in July with convolvuli and woodbine,
and now again in August comes the clematis and
the blackberry flower.

</div></div></div>

<p>The name “Night-Jar,” by which this lane is
known, is unusual, and probably points to its having
been a favourite hunting-ground for a seldom-seen
visitant, for which it seems well-fitted. The name
may well date back to White of Selborne’s time,
who lived not far away, and termed the bird “a
wonderful and curious creature,” which it must be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
if, as he records, it commences its jar, or note, every
evening so exactly at the close of day that it
coincided to a second with the report&mdash;which he
could distinguish in summer&mdash;of the Portsmouth
evening gun.</p>

<p>Night-jars are most deceptive in their flight,
one or two giving an illusion of many by their
extremely rapid movements and turns; and they
may well have been very noticeable to persons in
the confined space of this gully, especially as the
observer in his evening stroll would probably stir
up the moths, which are the bird’s favourite food,
and which would attract it into his immediate
vicinity. How much interest would be added to
a countryside were the lanes all fitted with titles
such as this.

<span class="large">COTTAGES AND HOMESTEADS</span></h2>

<p>The ancient haunts of men have numberless tongues for those
who know how to hear them speak.</p>

<p>It was not until some fifteen years of Mrs.
Allingham’s career as a painter in water-colour
had been accomplished that she found the subject
with which her name has since been so inseparably
linked. Looking through the ranks of her
associates in the Art it is in rare instances that
we encounter so complete a departure out of a
long-practised groove, or one which has been so
amply justified. But in selecting English Cottages
and Homesteads, and peopling them with a comely
tenantry, she happened upon a theme that was
certain not only to obtain the suffrages of the
ordinary exhibition visitors, but of those who add
to seeing, admiration and acquisition. Thus it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
has come to pass that in the other fifteen years
which have elapsed since she first began to paint
them, “Mrs. Allingham’s Cottages” have become
a household word amongst connoisseurs of English
water-colours, and no representative collection has
been deemed to be complete without an example
of them.</p>

<p>This appreciation is very assuredly a sound one,
as the value of these pictures does not consist
solely in their beauty as works of Art, but in their
recording in line and colour a most interesting but
unfortunately vanishing phase of English domestic
architecture. For the cottages are almost without
exception veritable portraits, the artist (whilst
naturally selecting those best suited to her purpose)
having felt it a duty to present them with
an accuracy of structural feature which is not
always the case in creations of this kind, where
the painter has had other views, and considered
that he could improve his picture by an addition
here and an omission there.</p>

<p>So many of Mrs. Allingham’s drawings of
cottages have been taken from the counties of
Surrey and Sussex, that it may interest not only
the owners of those here reproduced, but others
who possess similar subjects, to read a short
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
description of the features that distinguish the
buildings in these districts.</p>

<p>One is perhaps too apt to pass these lowlier
habitations of our fellow-men, whether we see
them in reality or in their counterfeits, without a
thought as to their structure, or an idea that it is
an evolution which has grown on very marked lines
from primitive types, and which in almost every
instance has been influenced by local surroundings.</p>

<p>In the early days of housebuilding the use of
local materials was naturally a distinctive feature
of dwellings of every kind, but more especially in
those where expenditure had to be kept within
narrow limits. But even in such a case the style
of architecture affected in the better built houses
influenced and may be traced in the more humble
ones. Change amongst our forefathers was even
less hastily assumed than in these days, and a style
which experience had proved to be convenient was
persevered in for generation after generation, individuality
seldom having any play, although a
necessary adaptation to the site gave to most
buildings a distinction of their own. One of the
earliest forms, and one still to be found even in
buildings which have now descended to the use of
yeomen’s dwellings, was that of a large central
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
room having on one side of it the smaller living
and sleeping rooms, and on the other the kitchens
and servants’ apartments, the wings projecting
sometimes both to back and front, sometimes only
to the latter. In later times, as such a house fell
into less well-to-do hands, necessity usually compelled
the splitting-up of the house into various
tenements, in which event the central room was
generally divided into compartments, often into a
complete dwelling. Types of this kind may be
found in most villages in the south-eastern counties,
and examples will be seen in “The Six Bells”
(<a href="#Plate_57">Plate 57</a>) and the house at West Tarring, near
Worthing (<a href="#Plate_51">Plate 51</a>), where the central portion
falls back from the gabled ends. This arrangement
of a central hall used for a living room, after going
out of favour for some centuries, is curiously
enough once more coming into fashion.</p>

<p>Local materials having, as we have said, much
to do with the structure, the type of dwelling that
we may expect to find in counties where wood was
plentiful, and the cost of preparing and putting it
on the ground less than that of quarrying, shaping,
and carrying stone, is the picturesque, timber-formed
cottage. Those interested in the plan of
construction, which was always simple, of these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
will find full details in Mr. Guy Dawber’s Introduction
to <i>Old Cottages and Farm Houses in
Kent and Sussex</i>, as well as many illustrations of
examples that occur in these counties.</p>

<p>The materials other than wood used for the
framework, and which were necessary to fill up the
interstices, were, in the better class of dwellings,
bricks; in others, a consistency formed of chopped
straw and clay, an outward symmetry of appearance
being gained by a covering of plaster where
it was not deemed advisable to protect the woodwork,
and of boarding or tiles where the whole
surface called for protection. Several of the
cottages illustrated in this volume have been protected
by these tilings on some part or another,
perhaps only on a gable end, most often on the
upper story, sometimes over the whole building,
but of course, principally, where it was most exposed
to the weather (see Cherry-Tree Cottage,
<a href="#Plate_43">Plate 43</a>; Chiddingfold, <a href="#Plate_44">Plate 44</a>; Shottermill,
<a href="#Plate_49">Plate 49</a>; and Valewood Farm, <a href="#Plate_50">Plate 50</a>). This
purpose of the tile in the old houses, and its use
only for protection, distinguishes them from the
modern erections, where it is oftentimes affixed in
the most haphazard style, and clearly without any
idea of fitting it where it will be most serviceable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>The space in the interior was very irregularly
apportioned, whilst the cubic space allotted to
living rooms, both on the ground and first floors,
was singularly insufficient for modern hygienic
views. A reason for the small size of the rooms
may have been that it enabled them to be more
readily warmed, either by the heat given off by the
closely-packed indwellers, or by the small wood
fires which alone could be indulged in. Little use
was made of the large space in the roof, but this
omission adds much to the picturesqueness of the
exterior, for the roofs gain in simplicity by their
unbroken surface and treatment. It is somewhat
astonishing that the old builders did not recognise
this costly disregard of space.</p>

<p>The roofs, like the framework, testify to the
geological formation and agricultural conditions of
the district.</p>

<p>The roof-tree was always of hand-hewn oak,
and this it was, according to Birket Foster, which
gave to many of the old roofs their pleasant curves
away from the central chimney. The ordinary
unseasoned sawn deal of the modern roof may
swag in any direction.</p>

<p>The roof-covering where the land was chiefly
arable, or the distance from market considerable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
was usually wheaten thatch, which was certainly
the most comfortable, being warm in winter and
cool in summer, just the reverse of the tiles or
slates that have practically supplanted it.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> In
other districts the cottages are covered with what
are known as stone slates, thick and heavy. Roofs
to carry the weight of these had always to be
flattened, with the result that they require mortaring
to keep out the wet. The West Tarring
cottage (<a href="#Plate_51">Plate 51</a>) is an instance of a stone roofing.</p>

<p>The red tiles, which were used for the most part,
are certainly the most agreeable to the artistic eye,
for their seemingly haphazard setting, due in part
to the builder and in part to nature, affords that
pleasure which always arises from an unstudied
irregularity of line. Roof tiles were made thicker
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
and less carefully in the old days, and our artist’s
truth in delineation may be detected in almost
any drawing by examining where the weight has
swagged away the tiles between the main roof
beams.</p>

<p>Unlike chimneys erected by our cottage builders
of to-day, which appear to issue out of a single
mould, those of the untutored architects of the
past present every variety of treatment and appearance.</p>

<p>The old solidly built chimney seen in many of
Mrs. Allingham’s cottages (Chiddingfold, Plate
44) is worthy of note as a type of many sturdy
fellows which have resisted the ravages of time,
and have stood for centuries almost without need
of repair. In old days the chimney was regarded
not only as a special feature but as an ornament,
and not as a necessary but ugly excrescence.
Although probably it only served for one room
in the house, that service was an important one,
and so materials were liberally used in its construction.</p>

<p>In Kent and Sussex many of the chimneys
are of brick, although the house and the base of
the chimney-stack are of stone. This arose from
the stone not lending itself to thin slabs, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
consequently being altogether too cumbrous and
bulky.</p>

<p>The windows in the old cottages were naturally
small when glass was a luxury, and became fewer
in number when a tax upon light was one of the
means for carrying on the country’s wars. They
were usually filled with the smallest panes, fitted
into lead lattice, so that breakages might be reduced
to the smallest area. Not much of this remains,
but a specimen of it is to be seen in the Old Buckinghamshire
House (<a href="#Plate_52">Plate 52</a>). One of the few
alterations that Mrs. Allingham allows herself is the
substitution of these diamond lattices throughout
a house where she finds a single example in any of
the lights, or if, as she has on more than one
occasion found, that they have been replaced by
others, and are themselves stacked up as rubbish.
She has in her studio some that have been served in
this way, and which have now become useful models.</p>

<p>It would be imagined that the sense of pride in
these, the last traces of their village ancestors,
would have prompted their descendants, whether
of the same kin or not, to deal reverently with them,
and endeavour to hand on as long as possible these
silent witnesses to the honest workmanship of their
forbears. Such, unfortunately, is but seldom the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
case. If any one will visit Witley with this book
in his hand, and compare the present state of the
few examples given there, not twenty years after
they were painted, he will see what is taking
place not only in this little village but through
the length and breadth of England. It is not
always wilful on the part of the landlord, but
arises from either his lack of sympathy, time, or
interest.</p>

<p>He probably has a sense of his duty to “keep
up” things, and so sends his agent to go round
with an architect and settle a general plan for
doing up the old places (usually described as
“tumbling down” or “falling to pieces”). Thereupon
a village builder makes an estimate and sends
in a scratch pack of masons and joiners, and between
them they often supplant fine old work, most of it
as firm as a rock, with poor materials and careless
labour, and rub out a piece of old England, irrecoverable
henceforth by all the genius in the world
and all the money in the bank. The drainage and
water supply, points where improvement is often
desirable, may be left unattended to. But whatever
else is decided on, no uneven tiled roofs,
with moss and houseleek, must remain; no thatch
on any pretence, nor ivy on the wall, nor vine along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
the eaves. The cherry or apple tree, that pushed
its blossoms almost into a lattice, will probably be
cut down, and the wild rose and honeysuckle hedge
be replaced by a row of pales or wires. The
leaden lattice itself and all its fellows, however
perfect, must inevitably give place to a set of
mean little square windows of unseasoned wood,
though perhaps on the very next property an
architect is building imitation old cottages with
lattices! With the needful small repairs, most of
the real old cottages would have lasted for many
generations to come, to the satisfaction of their
inhabitants and the delight of all who can feel the
charm of beauty combined with ancientness&mdash;a
charm once lost, lost for ever. And unquestionably
the well-repaired old cottages would generally be
more comfortable than the new or the done-up
ones, to say nothing of the “sentiment” of the
cottager. An old man, who was in a temporary
lodging during the doing-up of his cottage, being
asked, “When shall you get back to your house?”
answered, “In about a month, they tells me; but
it won’t be like going home.” At the same time
it is fair to add that many of the “doings-up” in
Mrs. Allingham’s country are of good intention
and less ruthless execution than may be seen elsewhere,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and that certain owners show a real feeling
of wise conservatism. It would perhaps be a low
estimate, however, to say that a thousand ancient
cottages are now disappearing in England every
twelvemonth, without trace or record left&mdash;many
that Shakespeare might have seen, some Chaucer;
while the number “done up” is beyond computation.</p>

<p>The baronial halls have had abundant recognition
and laudation at the hands of the historian
and the painter; the numerous manor-houses, less
pretentious, often more lovely, very little; the old
cottages next to none, even the local chronicler
running his spectacles over them without a
pause.</p>

<p>It really looks as if we were, one and all, constituted
as a poet has seen us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For, don’t you mark, we’re made so that we love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First when we see them painted, things we have passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so they are better, painted&mdash;better to us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is the same thing. Art was given for that&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God uses us to help each other so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lending our minds out.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Had Mrs. Allingham done nothing else for her
country, she has justified her career as a recorder
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
of this altogether overlooked phase of English
architecture&mdash;a phase which will soon be a thing
of the past.</p>

<p>I remember once being accosted by a bystander
in Angers, as I was wrestling with the perspective
of a beautiful old house, with the remark, “Ah,
you had better hurry more than you are doing and
finish the roof of that house, for it will be off to-morrow
and the whole down in three days.” That
has often been the case with Mrs. Allingham.
More than once a cottage limned one summer has
disappeared before the drawing was exhibited the
following spring. Year in and year out the process
has been at work during the quarter of a century
during which the artist has been garnering, and it
has almost come to be a joke that were she to
paint as long again as she has, she might have to
cease from actual lack of material.</p>

<p>Our illustrations of cottages divide themselves
into, first the examples in the immediate neighbourhood
of Sandhills; and secondly, those farther
afield in Kent, Buckingham, Dorset, the Isle of
Wight, and Cheshire.</p>

<p>Those near Sandhills form points in the circumference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of a circle of which it is the centre, the most
southern being Chiddingfold, where we start on our

<p>The old hamlet of Chiddingfold lies about as
far to the south as Witley does to the north of
the station on the London and South-Western
Railway which bears their joint names. It boasts
of a very ancient inn, “The Crown,”&mdash;formed, it is
said, in part out of a monastic building,&mdash;and a large
village green. Cherry-Tree Cottage is, as will be
seen, the milk shop of the place, and, if we may
judge from the coming and going in Mrs. Allingham’s
picture, carries on an animated, prosperous
trade at certain times of the day.</p>

<p>We have here a March day, or rather one of
the type associated with that month, but which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
usually visits us with increasing severity as April
and May and the summer progress. Wind in the
east, with the sky a cold, steely blue in the zenith,
greying even the young elm shoots a stone’s-throw
distant. The cottage almanack, Old Moore’s, will
foretell that night frosts will prevail, and the
cottager will be fearsome of its effect upon his
apple crop, always so promising in its blossom, so
scanty in its fulfilment. Splendid weather for the
full-blooded lassies, who can tarry to gossip without
fear of chills, and also for drying clothes on the
hedgerow, but nipping for the old beldame who
tends them, and who has to wrap up against it
with shawl and cap.</p>

<p>competes in colour with the spikes of the broom,
which the artist must have been thankful to the
hedgecutter for sparing as he passed his shears
along its surface when last he trimmed it. For
some reason the broom bears an ill repute hereabouts
as bringing bad luck, although in early
times it was put to a desirable use, as Gerard tells
us that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>“that worthy Prince of famous memory,
Henry VIII. of England, was wont to drink the

distilled water of Broome floures.” Wordsworth
also gives it<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> a special word in his lines&mdash;</p>

<p>The cottage contains a typical example of the
massive central chimney, and also an end one,
which it is unusual to find in company with the
other in so small a dwelling. Note also the weather
tiling round the gable end and the upper story.</p>

<p>For those who read between the lines there are
plenty of pretty allegories connected with these
drawings. This, for instance, might well be termed
“Youth and Age.” The venerable cottage in its
declining years, so appropriately set in a framework
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
of autumn tints and flowers, supported on its
colder side by the tendrils of ivy, almost of its own
age, but on its warmer side maturing a fruitful
vine, emblem of the mother and child which gather
at the gate, and of the brood of fowls which busily
search the wayside.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mrs. Le Poer Trench.</i><br />

<p>Half a century ago most of the old dwellings
on the Surrey border were thatched with good
wheaten straw from the Weald of Sussex, but
thatch will soon be a thing of the past, partly for
the reason that there are no thatchers (or “thackers”
as they are called in local midland dialect) left,
principally because the straw, of which they consumed
a good deal, and which used to be a cheap
commodity and not very realisable, in villages whose
access to market was difficult, now finds a ready
sale. Locomotion has also enabled slates to be
conveyed from hundreds of miles away, and placed
on the ground at a less rate than straw.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<p>Thus the old order changeth, and without any
regard to the comfort of the tenant, whose roof,
as I have already said, instead of consisting of a
covering which was warm in winter and cool in
summer, is now one which is practically the reverse.
Strawen roofs are easy of repair or renewal, and
look very trim and cosy when kept in condition.</p>

<p>At the time when this drawing was painted this
cottage, lying snugly in the recesses of Wormley
Wood (whose pines always attract the attention as
the train passes them just before Witley station is
reached), was the last specimen of thatch in the
neighbourhood, and it only continued so to be
through the intervention of a well-known artist
who lived not far off. That artist is dead, and
probably in the score of years which have since
elapsed the thatch has gone the way of the rest,
and the harmony of yellowish greys which existed
between it and its background have given way to
a gaudy contrast of unweathered red tiles or cold
unsympathetic blue slates.</p>

<p>The cottage itself may well date back to Tudor
times, and the sweetwilliams, pansies, and lavender
which border the path leading to it may be
the descendants of far-away progenitors, culled
by a long-forgotten labourer in his master’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
“nosegay garden,” which at that time was a luxury
of the well-to-do only.</p>

<p>Many of the flowers found in this plot of ground
were in early days conserved in the gardens of the
simple folk rather for their medicinal use than their
decorative qualities. Such was certainly the case
with lavender. “The floures of lavender do cure
the beating of the harte,” says one contemporary
herbal; and another written in Commonwealth
times says, “They are very pleasing and delightful
to the brain, which is much refreshed with their
sweetness.” It was always found in the garden of
women who pretended to good housewifery, not
only because the heads of the flowers were used for
“nosegays and posies,” but for putting into “linen
and apparel.”</p>

<p>Those who are ingenious enough to see the
inspiration of another hand in every work that an
artist produces would probably raise an outcry
against anybody infringing the copyright which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
they consider that Collins secured more than half
a century ago for the children swinging on a gate
in his “Happy as a King.” But who that examines
with any interest or care the figures in this water-colour
could for a moment believe that Mrs.
Allingham had ever had Collins even unconsciously
in her mind when she put in these happy little
mortals as adjuncts to her landscape. Having
enjoyed at ages such as theirs a swing on many a
gate, one can testify that these children must have
been seen, studied, and put in from the life and on
the spot. See how the elder girl leans over the
gate, with perfect self-assurance, directing the boy
as to how far back the gate may go; how the
younger one has to climb a rung higher than her
sister in order to obtain the necessary purchase with
her arms, and even then she can only do so with
a strain and with a certain nervousness as to the
result of the jar when the gate reaches the post on
its return. Again, some one has to do the swinging,
and Mrs. Allingham has given the proper touch of
gallantry by making the second in age of the party,
a boy, the first to undertake this part of the
business. The excitement of the moment has communicated
itself to the youngest of the family, who
raises his stick to cheer as the gate swings to.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Although painted within thirty miles of London,
the age of cheap rickety perambulators had not
reached the countryside when this drawing was
made nearly twenty years ago, and so we see the
youngest in a sturdy, hand-made go-cart.</p>

<p>The country folk who passed the artist when
she was making this drawing wondered doubtless
at her selection of a point of sight where practically
nothing but roof and wall of the building were
visible, when a few steps farther on its front door
and windows might have made a picture; but the
charm of the drawing exists in this simplicity of
subject, the greatest pleasure being procurable
from the least important features, such, for instance,
as the lichen-covered and leek-topped wall, and the
untended, buttercup-flecked bank on which it
stands. The locality of the drawing is Brook Lane,
near Witley, and the drawing was an almost exact
portrait of the cottage as it stood in 1886, but since
then it has been modernised like the majority of
its fellows, and though the oak-timbered walls,
tiled roof, and massive chimney still stand, the old
curves of the roof-tree have gone, and American
windows have replaced the old lattices. The other
side of the house, as it then appeared, has been
preserved to us in the next picture.

<p>The art critic of <i>The Times</i>, in speaking of the
Exhibition where this drawing was exhibited, singled
it out as “taking rank amongst the very best of
Mrs. Allingham’s work, and the very model of what
an English water-colour should be, with its woodside
cottage, its tangled hedges, its background of
sombre fir trees, and figures of the girl with basket,
and of the cottagers to whom she is offering her
wares, showing as it does intense love for our
beautiful south country landscape, with the power
of seizing its most picturesque aspects with truth
of eye and delicacy of hand.”</p>

<p>To my mind the most remarkable feature of the
drawing is the way in which the long stretch of
hedge has been managed. In most hands it would
either be a monotonous and uninteresting feature
or an absolute failure, for the difficulty of lending
variety of surface and texture to so large a mass is
only known to those who have attempted it; it
could only be effected by painting it entirely from
nature and on the spot, as was the case here.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Many would have been tempted to break it up by
varieties of garden blooms, but Mrs. Allingham has
only relieved it by a st/ray spray or two of wild
honeysuckle, which never flowers in masses, and
a few white convolvuli.</p>

<p>That we are not far removed from the small
hop district which is to be found west and northward
of this part is evidenced by the hops which
the old woman was in course of plucking from the
pole when her attention was arrested by the
wandering pedlar. This and the apples ripening
on the straggling apple tree show the season to be
early autumn, whereas the elder bush in the
companion drawing puts its season as June.</p>

HASLEMERE<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. W. D. Houghton.</i><br />

Painted 1891.</span></h3>

<p>Each of three counties may practically claim
this cottage for one of its types, for it lies absolutely
at the junction of Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire.</p>

<p>For a single tenement it is particularly roomy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and a comfortable one to boot, for its screen of
tiles is carried so low down.</p>

<p>It was a curious mood of the artist’s to sit down
square in front of it and paint its paling paralleling
across the picture, a somewhat daring stroke of
composition to carry on the line of white tiling
with one of white clothes. The sky displays an
unusual departure from the artist’s custom, as the
whole length of it is banked up with banks of
cumuli.</p>

<p>The figures and the empty basket point to a
little domestic episode. Boy and girl have been
sent on an errand, but have not got beyond the
farther side of the gate before they betake themselves
to a loll on the grass, which has lengthened
out to such an extent that the old grand-dame
comes to the cottage door to look for their return,
little witting that they are quietly crouched within
a few feet of her, hidden behind the paling, over
which lavender, sweet-pea, roses, peonies, and
hollyhocks nod at them. They are even less
conscious of wrong-doing and of impending scoldings
than the cat, which sneaks homewards after
a lengthened absence on a poaching expedition.

<p>Valewood is over the ridge which protects
Haslemere on the south, and is a very pretty vale
of sloping meadows fringed with wood, all under
the shadow of Blackdown, to which it belongs.
This is distinguished from most houses hereabouts
in boasting a stream, the headwater of a string of
ponds, whence starts the river Wey northwards
on its tortuous journey round the western slopes
of Hindhead. When Mrs. Allingham painted the
house, which was inhabited by well-to-do yeomen
from Devonshire, the dairying and the milking
were still conducted by desirable hands, namely,
those of milkmaids.</p>

<p>Worthing has been termed “a dull and dreary
place, the only relief to which is its suburb of
West Tarring.” This happening to have been one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
of the “peculiars” of the Archbishops of Canterbury,
has buildings and objects of considerable antiquarian
interest. The cottages which Mrs. Allingham
selected for her drawing may be classed amongst
them, for they are a type, as good as any in this
volume, of the well-built, substantial dwelling-house
of our progenitors of many centuries ago&mdash;one in
which all the features that we have pointed out are
to be found. The house has in course of time
clearly become too big for its situation, and has
consequently been parcelled out into cottages;
this has necessitated some alteration of the front
of the lower story, but otherwise it is an exceptionally
well-preserved specimen. Long may it
remain so.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat rare instance of the artist
selecting for portraiture a house of larger dimensions
than a cottage. It is a singular trait, perhaps
a womanly trait, that we never find her choice
falling upon the country gentleman’s seat, although
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
their formal gardening and parterres of flowers
must oftentimes have tempted her. Her selection,
in fact, never rises beyond the wayside tenement,
which in that before us no doubt once housed a
well-to-do yeoman, but was, when Mrs. Allingham
limned it, only tenanted in part by a small farmer
and in part by a butcher. But it is planned and
fashioned on the old English lines to which we
have referred, and which in the days when it was
built governed those of the dwelling of every well-to-do
person.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. Maurice Hill.</i><br />

<p>The trend of the trees indicates that this scene
is laid where the winds are not only strong, but
blow most frequently from one particular quarter.
It is, in fact, on the coast of Dorset, at Burton, a
little seaside resort of the inhabitants of Bridport,
when they want a change from their own water-side
town. The English Channel comes up to one
side of the buttercup-clad field, and was behind
the artist as she sat to paint the carrier’s cottage,
a man of some local celebrity, who took the artist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
to task for not painting his home from a particular
point of view, saying, “I’ve had it painted many
a time, and theyse always took it from there.”
He was a man accustomed to boss the village in a
kindly but firm way, never allowing any controversy
concerning his charges, which were, however,
always reasonable. Hence he had come to be
nicknamed “The Duke,” and as such did not
understand Mrs. Allingham’s declining at once to
recommence her sketch at the spot he indicated.</p>

<p>The Dorsetshire cottages, for the most part, differ
altogether from their fellows in Surrey and Sussex,
for their walls are made of what would seem to be
the flimsiest and clumsiest materials,&mdash;dried mud,
intermixed with straw to give it consistency, entering
mainly into their composition. Many are not
far removed from the Irish cabins, of which we see
an example in <a href="#Plate_78">Plate 78</a>.</p>

<p>In speaking of Duke’s Cottage, I dwelt upon
the poor materials of which it and its Dorsetshire
fellows were made, and this, coupled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
Mrs. Allingham presenting a picture of one that is
too decayed to live in, may raise a suggestion as to
their instability. But such is not the case. The
lack of substance in the material is made up by
increased thickness, and the cottage before us has
stood the wear and tear of several hundred years,
and now only lacks a tenant through its insanitary
condition. A robin greeted the artist from the
topmost of the grass-grown steps, glad no doubt
to see some one about the place once more.</p>

<p>Ide Hill is to be found in Kent, on the south

given place to the newly built and commonplace.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
The view from hereabouts is very fine&mdash;so fine,
indeed, that Miss Octavia Hill has, for some time,
been endeavouring, and at last with success, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
preserve a point for the use of the public whence
the best can be seen.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. A. S. Littlejohns.</i><br />

<p>The almost invariable rule of the south, that
cottages are formed out of the local material that
is nearest to hand, is clearly not practised farther
north, to judge by this example of a typical
Cheshire cottage.</p>

<p>Stone is apparently so ready to hand that not
only is the roadway paved with it, but even the
approach to the cottage, whilst the large blocks
seen elsewhere in the picture show that it is not
limited in size. Yet the only portion of the building
that is constructed of stone, so far as we can
see, is the lean-to shed.</p>

<p>The cottage itself differs in many respects from
those we have been used to in Surrey and Sussex.
The roof is utilised, in fact the level of the first
floor is on a line almost with its eaves, and a
large bay window in the centre, and one at the end,
show that it is well lighted. Heavy barge-boards
are affixed to the gables, which is by no means
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
always the case down south, and the wooden framework
has at one time been blackened in consonance
with a custom prevalent in Cheshire and Lancashire,
but which is probably only of comparatively
recent date; for gas-tar, which is used, was not
invented a hundred years ago, and there seems no
sense in a preservative for oak beams which usually
are almost too hard to drive a nail into. The
fashion is probably due to the substitution of unseasoned
timber for oak.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. G. Wills.</i><br />

<p>This beautiful old specimen of a timbered house
was discovered by Mrs. Allingham by accident
when staying with some artistic friends at Bearsted,
in Kent, who were unaware of its existence.
Although the weather was very cold and the
season late, she lost no time in painting it, as its
inmates said that it would be pulled down directly
its owner, an old lady of ninety-two, who was very
ill, died. Having spent a long day absorbed in
putting down on paper its intricate details, she
went into the house for a little warmth and a cup
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
of tea, only to find a single fire, by which sat a
labourer with his pot of warmed ale on the hob.
Asking whether she could not go to some other
fire, she was assured that nowhere else in the
house could one be lit, as water lay below all the
floors, and a fire caused this to evaporate and fill
the rooms with steam.</p>

<p>As we have said, Mrs. Allingham alters her
compositions as little as possible when painting
from Nature, but in this case she has omitted a
church tower that stood just to the right of the
inn, and added the tall trees behind it. The omission
was due to a feeling that the house itself was
the point, and a quite sufficient point of interest,
that would only be lessened by a competing one.
The addition of the trees was made in order to
give value to the grey of the house-side, which
would have been considerably diminished by a
broad expanse of sky.</p>

<p>Farmyards are out of fashion nowadays, and a
Royal Water-Colour Society’s Exhibition, which in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
the days of Prout and William Hunt probably contained
a dozen of them, will now find place for a
single example only from the hand of Mr. Wilmot
Pilsbury, who alone faithfully records for us the
range of straw-thatched buildings sheltering an
array of picturesque waggons and obsolete farming
implements. But this “stead” is just opposite to
the farm in which Mrs. Allingham stays, and it
has often attracted her on damp days by its looking
like “a blaze of raw sienna.” We can understand
the tiled expanse of steep-pitched, moss-covered
roof affording her some of that material
on which her heart delights, and which she has
felt it a duty to hand down to posterity before it
gives place to some corrugated iron structure which
must, ere long, supplant this old timber-built barn.</p>

<p>What was originally a study has been transformed
by her, through the human incidents, into
a picture: the milkmaid carrying the laden pail
from the byre; the cock on the dunghill, seemingly
amazed that his wives are too busily engaged on
its contents to admire him; the lily-white ducks
waddling to the pool to indulge in a drink, the
gusto of which seems to increase in proportion to
the questionableness of its quality.

<span class="i0">Than anywhere else on earth.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The practice of painting gardens is almost as
modern as that of painting by ladies. The
Flemings of the fifteenth century, it is true,
introduced in a delightful fashion conventional
borders of flowers into some of their pictures,
probably because they felt that ornament must be
presented from end to end of them, and that in no
way could they do this better than by adding the
gaiety of flowers to their foregrounds. But all
through the later dreary days no one touched the
garden, for the conglomeration of flowers in the
pieces of the Dutchmen of the seventeenth century
cannot be treated as such. Flowers certainly
flourished in the gardens of the well-to-do in
England in the century between 1750 and 1850,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
but none of the limners of the drawings of noblemen
or of gentlemen’s seats which were produced
in such quantities during that period ever condescended
to introduce them. Even so late as
fifty years ago, if we may judge from the titles,
the Royal Academy Exhibition of that date did
not contain a single specimen of a flower-garden.
The only probable one is a picture entitled “Cottage
Roses,” and any remotely connected with the
garden appear under such headings as “Early
Tulips,” “Geraniums,” “Japonicas and Orchids,”
“Will you have this pretty rose, Mamma?” or
“The Last Currants of Summer”! Taste only
half a century ago was different from ours, and
asked for other provender. Thus, the original
owner of the catalogue from which these statistics
were taken was an energetic amateur critic, who
has commended, or otherwise, almost every picture,
commendations being signified by crosses and disapproval
by noughts. The only work with five
crosses is one illustrating the line, “Now stood
Eliza on the wood-crown’d height.” On the other
hand, Millais’ “Peace Concluded” stands at the
head of the bad marks with five, his “Blind Girl”
with two, which number is shared with Leighton’s
“Triumph of Music.” Holman Hunt’s “Scapegoat,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
in addition to four bad marks, is described as
“detestable and profane.” These pre-Raphaelites,
Millais, Holman Hunt, and their followers, then
so little esteemed, may in truth be said to have
been the originators of the “garden-drawing cult,”
chief amongst their followers being Frederick
Walker. To the example of the last-named
more especially are due the productions of the
numerous artists&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;who
have seized upon a delightful subject and
almost nauseated the public with their productions.
The omission of gardens from the painter’s <i>r&ocirc;le</i> in
later times may in a measure have been due to the
gardens themselves, or, to speak more correctly, to
those under whose charge they were maintained.
The ideal of a garden to the true artist must always
have differed from these as to its ordering, even in
these very recent days when the edict has gone forth
that Nature is to be allowed a hand in the planning.</p>

<p>The gardener, no matter whether the surroundings
favour a formal garden or not, insists upon his
harmonies or contrasts of brilliant colourings. If
he takes these from a manual on gardening he will
adopt what is termed a procession of colouring
somewhat as follows: strong blues, pale yellow,
pink, crimson, strong scarlet, orange, and bright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
yellow. He is told that his colours are to be
placed with careful deliberation and forethought,
as a painter employs them in his picture, and not
dropped down as he has them on his palette!
Alfred Parsons and George Elgood have on
occasions grappled with creations such as these,
when placed in settings of yew-trimmed hedges, or
as surroundings of a central statue, or sundial;
but who will say that the results have been as
successful as those where formality has been
merely a suggestion, and Nature has had her say
and her way. Surroundings must, of course, play
a prominent part in any garden scheme. However
much we may dislike a stiff formality, it is
sometimes a necessity. For instance, herbaceous
plants, with annuals of mixed colours, would have
looked out of place on the lawn in front of Brocket
Hall (<a href="#Plate_65">Plate 65</a>), which calls for a mass of plants
of uniform colours. The lie of the ground, too,
must, as in such a case, be taken into account:
there it is a sloping descent facing towards the sun,
and so is not easy to keep in a moist condition.
Geraniums and calceolarias, which stand such conditions,
are therefore almost a necessity.</p>

<p>When this book was proposed to Mrs. Allingham
her chief objection was her certainty that no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
process could reproduce her drawings satisfactorily.
Her method of work was, she believed, entirely opposed
to mechanical reproduction, for she employed
not only every formula used by her fellow water-colourists,
but many that others would not venture
upon. Amongst those she tabulated was her
system of obtaining effects by rubbing, scrubbing,
and scratching. But the process was not to be
denied, and she was fain to admit that even in
these it has been a wonderfully faithful reproducer.
Now nowhere are these methods of Mrs. Allingham’s
more utilised, and with greater effect, than
in her drawings of flower-gardens. The system of
painting flowers in masses has undergone great
changes of late. The plan adopted a generation
or so ago was first to draw and paint the flowers
and then the foliage. This method left the flowers
isolated objects and the foliage without substantiality.
Mrs. Allingham’s method is the reverse of
this. Take, for instance, the white clove pinks in
the foreground of Mrs. Combe’s drawing of the
kitchen-garden at Farringford (<a href="#Plate_71">Plate 71</a>). These
are so admirably done that their perfume almost
scents the room. They have been simply carved
out of a background of walk and grey-green spikes,
and left as white paper, all their drawing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
modelling being achieved by a dexterous use of
the knife and a wetted and rubbed surface. The
poppies, roses, columbines, and stocks have all
been created in the same way. The advantage is
seen at once. There are no badly pencilled outlines,
and the blooms blend amongst themselves
and grow naturally out of their foliage.</p>

<p>A very interesting series of studies of various
kinds might have been included in this volume,
which would have shown the thoroughness with
which our artist works, and it was with much
reluctance that we discarded all but two, in the
interests of the larger number of our readers, who
might have thought them better fitted for a
manual of instruction. The Gloire de Dijon rose,
however, is such a prime old favourite, begotten
before the days of scentless specimens to which
are appended the ill-sounding names of fashionable
patrons of the rose-grower, that we could not keep
our hands off it when we came across it in the
artist’s portfolio.

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. F. G. Debenham.</i><br />

<p>Of the denizens of the garden there is perhaps
none which appeals to a countryman who has
drifted into the city so much as the wallflower.
His senses both of sight and smell have probably
grown up under its influence, and it carries him
back to the home of his childhood, for it is of
never-to-be-forgotten sweetness both in colour and
in scent, and it conjures up old days when the rare
warmth of an April sun extracted its perfume until
all the air in its neighbourhood was redolent of it.</p>

<p>If my reader be a west countryman, like the
author, he may best know it as the gilliflower, but
he will do so erroneously, for the name rightly
applies to the carnation, and was so used even in
Chaucer’s time&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">The great clove carnation Gillo-Floure.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But as a “rose by any other name would smell as
sweet,” every true flower-lover cherishes his wallflower,
which returns to him so bountifully the
slightest attention, which accepts the humblest
position, which thrives on the scantiest fare, which
is amongst the first to welcome us in the spring,
and, with its scantier second bloom, amongst the
last to bid adieu in the autumn, sometimes even
striving to gladden us with its blossom year in and
year out if winter’s cold be not too stark.</p>

<p>Old names give place to new, and in nurserymen’s
catalogues we search in vain for its pleasant-sounding
title, and fail to distinguish either its
reproduction in black and white, or its designation
under that of cheiranthus.</p>

than that which gives to each a purposed scheme
of colour&mdash;a scheme, however, that is, with set
purpose, hidden away, so that the flowers may
look as if they grew, as they appear to do,
by chance. The flowers, too, are old-fashioned
inhabitants: pansies, sea-pinks, marigolds, sweetwilliams,
snap-dragons, eschscholtzias, and flags,
with a background of rose bushes; all of them
(with the exception, perhaps, of the flag) flowers

concerning the contrast between the pink of the
flower and the blue of the distance. But here
the interval between the colours is not the
exaggerated fifty miles of the poem, but one
insufficient to dim the shapes of the trees on the

here illustrated none offers a greater wealth of
colour than this Kentish garden, situated as it is
with an aspect which makes it a veritable sun-trap.</p>

<p>The cabbage is probably to most people the
most uninteresting tenant of the kitchen-garden,
and yet its presence there was probably the motive
which set Mrs. Allingham to work to make this
drawing, for it is clear that in the first instance it
was conceived as a study of the varied and delicate
mother-of-pearl hues which each presented to an
artistic eye. As a piece of painting it is extremely
meritorious through its being absolutely straight-forward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
drawing and brush work, the high lights
being left, and not obtained by the usual method
of cutting, scraping, or body colour. The buxom
mother of a growing family selecting the best plant
for their dinner is just the personal note which
distinguishes each and every one of our illustrations.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from drawing attention to this
reproduction as one of the wonders of the “three
colour process.” If my readers could see the three
colours which produce the result when superimposed,
first the yellow, then the red, and lastly
the blue&mdash;aniline hues of the most forbidding
character&mdash;they would indeed deem it incredible
that any resemblance to the original could be
possible. It certainly passes the comprehension
of the uninitiated how the differing delicacies of
the violet hues of the flowers to the left could
be obtained from a partnership which produced
the blue black of the flowers in the foreground,
the light pinks of the Shirley poppies, and the rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
reds of the sweetwilliams. Again, what a marvel
must the photographic process be which refuses
to recognise the snow-white campanula, and
leaves it to be defined by the untouched paper,
and yet records the faint pink flush which has
been breathed upon the edges of the sweetwilliam.
It is indeed a tribute to the inventive genius of
the present day, genius which will probably enable
the “press the button and we do the rest photographer”
before many days are past to reel off
in colour what he now can only accomplish in
monochrome.</p>

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Lord Mount-Stephen.</i><br />

Painted 1900.</span></h3>

<p>Portraiture of time-worn cottages where Nature
has its way, and cottars’ gardens where flowers
come and go at their own sweet will, is a very
different thing from portraiture of a well-kept
house, where the bricklayer and the mason are
requisitioned when the slightest decay shows itself,
and of gardens where formal ribbon borders are
laid out by so-called landscape gardeners, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
taste always leans to bright colours not always
massed in the happiest way. In portraits of houses
license is hardly permissible even for artistic effects,
for not only may associations be connected with
every slope and turn of a path, but the artist
always has before him the possibility that the
drawing will be hung in close proximity to the
scene, for comparison by persons who may not
always be charitably disposed to artistic alterations.
It speaks well, therefore, for Mrs. Allingham
in the drawing of the garden at Brocket
that she has produced a drawing which, without
offending the conventions, is still a picture harmonious
in colour, and probably very satisfying
to the owner. There are few who would have
cared to essay the very difficult drawing of cedars,
and have accomplished it so well, or have laboured
with so much care over the plain-faced house and
windows. As to these latter she has been happy
in assisting the sunlight in the picture by the
drawn-down blinds at the angles which the sun
reaches. The scene has clearly been pictured in
the full blaze of summer.</p>

<p>Brocket Hall is a mansion some three miles
north of Hatfield, Hertfordshire, and a short distance
off the Great North Road. It is one of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
string of seats hereabouts which belong to Earl
Cowper, but has been tenanted by Lord Mount-Stephen
for some years. The house, which, as
will be seen, has not much architectural pretensions,
was built in the eighteenth century, but
it is, to cite an old chronicle, “situate on a
dry hill in a fair park well wooded and greatly
timbered” through which the river Lea winds
picturesquely. It is notable as having been the
residence of two Prime Ministers, Lord Melbourne
and Lord Palmerston. The drawing of
“The Hawthorn Valley” (<a href="#Plate_37">Plate 37</a>) is taken from
a part of the park.</p>

and scarlets, the whites being formed of yuccas,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
the pinks of hollyhocks, the reds and yellows of
gladioli, nasturtiums, African marigolds, herbaceous
sunflowers, dahlias, and geraniums. Another

<p>A further illustration of the same border in
Miss Jekyll’s garden, but painted a year or two

cool colours are coming into the scheme. The
orange-red flowers hanging over the wall are those
of the <i>Bignonia grandiflora</i>; the bushes on either
side of the archway with white flowers are choisyas,
and the adjoining ones are red and yellow dahlias,
flanked by tritonias (red-hot pokers); the oranges
in front are African marigolds (hardly reproduced
sufficiently brightly), with white marguerites; the
grey-leaved plant to the left is the <i>Cineraria
maritima</i>. Miss Jekyll does not entirely keep to
her arrangement of masses of colour; whilst, as
an artist, she affects rich masses of colour, she is
not above experimenting by breaking in varieties.

probably considered her artistic perception to be
peculiar, and some there may be who will deem
the honour given to it by introduction into these

more than one claim to recognition here, for it is
unusual in subject, delicate in its violet tints, not

<span class="large">TENNYSON’S HOMES</span></h2>

<p>Few poets have been so fortunate in their residences
as was the great Poet Laureate of the Victorian
era in the two which he for many years called his
own. Selected in the first instance for their beauty
and their seclusion, they had other advantages
which fitted them admirably to a poet’s temperament.</p>

<p>Farringford, at the western end of the Isle of
Wight, was the first to be acquired, being purchased
in 1853; it was Tennyson’s home for forty years,
and the house wherein most of his best-known
works were written. At the time when it came
into his hands communication with the mainland
was of the most primitive description, and the poet
and his wife had to cross the Solent in a rowing-boat.
So far removed was he from intrusion
there that he could indulge in what to him were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
favourite pastimes&mdash;sweeping up the leaves, mowing
the grass, gravelling the walks, and digging the
beds&mdash;without interruption. Many of the visitors
which railway and steamship facilities brought to
the neighbourhood in later years felt that he set the
boundary within which no foot other than his own
and that of his friends should tread at an extreme
limit. Golfers over the Needles Links&mdash;persons
who, perhaps, are prone to consider that whatever
is capable of being made into a course should be
so utilised&mdash;were wont to look with covetous eyes
over a portion of the downs that would have
formed a much-needed addition to their course,
but over which no ball was allowed to be played.
But the pertinacity of the crowd, in endeavouring
to get a sight of the Laureate, necessitated an
inexorable rule if the retreat was to be what it
was intended, namely, a place for work and for
rest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tennyson thus described “her wild house
amongst the pine trees”:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The golden green of the trees, the burning splendour of
Blackgang Chine, and the red bank of the primeval river
contrasted with the turkis blue of the sea (that is our view
from the drawing-room) make altogether a miracle of beauty
at sunset. We are glad that Farringford is ours.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<p>Although at times the weather can be cold and
bleak enough in this sheltered corner of the Isle
of Wight, and</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The scream of a madden’d beach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged down by the wave<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>must oftentimes have “shocked the ear” in the
Farringford house, the climate is too relaxing an
one for continued residence, and Tennyson’s second
house, Aldworth, was well chosen as a contrast.
Aubrey Vere thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It lifted England’s great poet to a height from which he
could gaze on a large portion of that English land which he
loved so well, see it basking in its most affluent beauty, and
only bound by the inviolate sea.</p></blockquote>

<p>The house stands at an elevation of some six
hundred feet above the sea, on the spur of Blackdown,
which is the highest ground in Sussex, on
a steep side towards the Weald, just where the
greensand hills break off. It is some two miles
from Haslemere, and just within the Sussex border.</p>

<p>Two of the drawings connected with these houses,
which are reproduced here, were painted before
Tennyson’s death, namely, in 1890.</p>

<p>The house at Farringford was drawn in the
spring, when the lawn was pied with daisies, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the Laureate required his heavy cloak to guard him
from the keenness of the April winds.</p>

<p>The kitchen-garden at Farringford, which somewhat
belies its name, for flowers encroach everywhere
upon the vegetables, and the apple trees rise
amidst a parterre of blossom, was painted in its
summer aspect, when it was gay with pinks, stocks,
rockets, larkspurs, delphiniums, aubrietias, eschscholtzias,
and big Oriental poppies. Tennyson
visited it almost daily to take the record of the rain-gauge
and thermometer, which can be descried in
the drawing about half-way down the path.</p>

<p>The kitchen-garden at Aldworth opens up a
very different prospect to the banked-up background
of trees at Farringford. Standing at a very
considerable elevation, it commands a magnificent
view over the Weald of Sussex. The spot is referred
to in the poem “Roses on the Terrace”
in the volume entitled <i>Demeter</i>, thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This red flower, which on our terrace here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glows in the blue of fifty miles away;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>as also in the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Green Sussex fading into blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one grey glimpse of sea.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was this view that the dying poet longed to see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
once again on his last morning when he cried, “I
want the blinds up! I want to see the sky and the
light!”</p>

<p>The time of year when Mrs. Allingham painted
it was October, and a wet October too, for two
umbrellas even could not keep her from getting
wet through.</p>

<p>It is rare for Mrs. Allingham to set her flowers
so near the horizon as in this case,&mdash;in fact I only
remember having seen another instance of it,&mdash;but
no doubt the same feeling that appealed to
the poet’s eye, and impelled him to pen the lines
we have quoted, fascinated the artist’s, namely, the
beautiful appearance of the varied hues of flowers
against a background of delicate blue.</p>

<p>October is the saddest time of year for the
garden, but a basket full of gleanings at that time
is more cherished than one in the full heyday of
its magnificence. Here the apple tree has already
shed most of its leaves, the hollyhock stems are
baring, and autumnal flowers, in which yellow so
much predominates, as, for instance, the great
marigold, the herbaceous sunflower, and the
calliopsis, are much in evidence. Nasturtiums
and every free-growing creeper have long ere
this trailed their stems over the box edging,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and made an untidiness which forebodes their
early destruction at the hands of the gardener.
Of sweet-scented flowers only a few peas and
mignonette remain.</p>

<p>Mr. Allingham knew the Poet Laureate for
many years, having at one time lived at Lymington,
which is the port of departure for the western
end of the Isle of Wight, and whence he often
crossed to Farringford. The artist’s first meeting
with Tennyson was soon after her marriage. He
and his son Hallam had come up to town, and
had walked over from Mr. James Knowles’s house
at Clapham, where they were staying, to Chelsea.
He invited Mrs. Allingham to Aldworth, an
invitation which was accepted shortly afterwards.
The poet was very proud of the country which
framed his house, and during this visit he took her
his special walks to Blackdown, to Fir Tree Corner
(whence there is a wide view over the Weald towards
the sea), and to a great favourite of his,
the Foxes’ Hole, a lovely valley beyond his own
grounds. Whilst on this last-named ramble he
suddenly turned round and chided the artist for
“chattering instead of looking at the view.”
During this visit he read to her a part of his
<i>Harold</i>, and the wonder of his voice and whole
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
manner of reading or chanting she will never
forget.</p>

<p>When the Allinghams came to live at Witley
they were able to get to and from Aldworth in an
afternoon, and so were frequent visitors there.
One day in the autumn of 1881 Mrs. Allingham
went over alone, owing to her husband’s absence,
and after lunch the poet walked with her to
Foxes’ Hole, where they sat on bundles of peasticks,
she painting an old cottage since pulled
down, and he watching her. After a time he
said slowly, “I should like to do that. It does
not look very difficult.” Years later he showed
her some water-colour drawings he had made,
from imagination, of Mount Ida clad in dark fir
groves, which were undoubtedly very clever in
their suggestiveness.</p>

<p>Lord Tennyson’s Isle of Wight home Mrs.
Allingham did not see until after she returned
to live in London, when Mr. Hallam Tennyson,
in conversing with her about her drawings, told
her that if she would come to the Isle of Wight
he could show her some fine old cottages. She
accordingly went at the Easter of 1890 to Freshwater,
when he was as good as his word, and she
at once began drawings of “The Dairy” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
the cottage “At Pound Green.” Miss Kate
Greenaway, who had come to stay with her,
also painted them. The next spring, and many
springs afterwards, Mrs. Allingham went to Freshwater,
generally after the Easter holidays.</p>

<p>During one of these stays she accompanied
Birket Foster to Farringford, and the poet asked
the two artists to come for a walk with him.
There happened to be a boy of the party in a
sailor costume with a bright blue collar and a
scarlet cap, and Birket Foster, who was at the
moment walking behind with Mrs. Allingham,
said, “Why is that red and blue so disagreeable?”
Tennyson’s quick ear caught something, and he
turned on them, setting his stick firmly in the
ground, and asked Mr. Foster to explain himself.
“Well,” Mr. Foster said, “I only know that the
effect of the contrast is to make cold water run
down my spine.” Mrs. Allingham cordially agreed
with Mr. Birket Foster, but Tennyson could not
feel the “cold water,” although he saw their point,
and said it was doubtless with painters as with
himself in poetry, namely, that some combinations
of sound gave intense pleasure, whilst others
grated, and he quoted certain lines as being so to
him. On another occasion, whilst walking with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
him at Freshwater, he said something which led
Mrs. Allingham to mention that she generally
kept her drawings by her for a long time, often
for years, working on them now and again and
considering about figures and incidents for them,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
upon which he remarked that it was the same in
the case of poems, and that he used generally to
keep his by him, often in print, for a considerable
time before publishing.</p>

<p>An old farmhouse on the other side of the
Yar Valley to Farringford, but one which Tennyson
often made an object for a walk. It possessed
a fine yard and old thatch-covered barn, which,
however, has passed out of existence, but not
before Mrs. Allingham had perpetuated it in
water-colour. This group of buildings has been
painted by the artist from every side, and at
other seasons than that represented here, when

<p>To the cottage-born child of to-day the name
of the “Pound” has little significance, but even
in the writer’s recollection it not only had a
fascination but a feeling almost akin to terror,
being deemed, in very truth, to be a prison for
the dumb animals who generally, through no fault
of their own, were impounded there. Both it and
its tenants too were always suggestive of starvation.
When (following, at some interval of time,
the village stocks) it passed out of use, the countryside,
in losing both, forgot a very cruel phase of
life.</p>

<p>A child of to-day has, with all its education,
not acquired many amusements to replace that
of teasing the tenants of the Pound on the Green,
so he never tires of pulling anything with the
faintest similitude to the cart which he will probably
spend much of his later life in driving. Here
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the youngster has evidently been making stabling
for his toy under a seat whose back is formed out
of some carved relic of an old sailing-ship that
was probably wrecked at the Needles, and whose
remains the tide carried in to Freshwater Bay.</p>

<p>Tramps are usually few and far between in the
Isle of Wight, for the reason that the island does
not rear many, and those from the mainland do
not care to cross the Solent lest, should they be
tempted to wrong-doing, there may be a difficulty
in avoiding the arm of the law or the confines of
the island. It is somewhat surprising, therefore,
to find the only flaw in our title of <i>Happy England</i>

<p>We have the rift, making the discordant note, of
want, in the person of a woman, dragged down
with the burden of four children, sending the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
eldest to beg a crust at a house which cannot
contain a superfluity of the good things of this
world.</p>

<p>A singular interest attaches to Mrs. Allingham’s
drawing of this cottage. She had nearly
completed it on a Saturday afternoon, and was
asked by a friend whether she would finish it next
day. To this she replied that she never sketched
in public on Sunday. On Monday the cottage
was a heap of ruins, having been burnt down the
previous night.

<span class="large">MRS. ALLINGHAM AND HER CONTEMPORARIES</span></h2>

<p>That a true artist is always individual, and that
his work is always affected by some one or other
of his predecessors or contemporaries, would appear
to be a paradox: nevertheless it is a proposition
that few will dispute. Art has been practised
for too long a period, and by too many talented
professors, for entirely novel views or treatments
of Nature to be possible, and whilst an artist may
be entirely unaware that he has imbibed anything
from others, it is certain that if he has had eyes to
see he must have done so.</p>

<p>I have already stated that Mrs. Allingham’s
work, whether in subject or execution, is, so far as
she is aware, entirely her own, and it would,
perhaps, be quite sufficient were I to leave the
matter after having placed that assertion on record.
To go farther may perhaps lay oneself open to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
charge, <i>qui s’excuse s’accuse</i>. I trust not, and that
I may be deemed to be only doing my duty if I
deal at some length with comparisons that have
been made between her work and that of certain
other artists.</p>

<p>The two names with whose productions those
of Mrs. Allingham are most frequently linked are
Frederick Walker and Birket Foster: the first in
connection with her figures, the latter with her
cottage subjects.</p>

<p>As regards these two artists it must be remembered
that both their and her early employment
lay in the same direction, namely, that of
book illustration, and therefore each started with
somewhat similar methods of execution and subject,
varied only by leanings towards the style of any
work they came in contact with, or by their own
individuality.</p>

<p>That both had much in common is well known;
in fact, Mrs. Allingham used to tell Mr. Foster
that she considered him, as did others, the father
of Walker and Pinwell.</p>

<p>In the case of Frederick Walker, his career
was at its most interesting phase whilst Mrs.
Allingham was a student. Her first visit to the
Royal Academy was probably in 1868, when his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
“Vagrants” was exhibited, to be followed in 1869
by “The Old Gate,” in 1870 by “The Plough,”
and in 1872 by “The Harbour of Refuge.”</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that the name of
Frederick Walker was at this time in every one’s
mouth, that is, every one who could be deemed to
be included in the small Art world of those days.
The painter visitors to the Academy schools sang
his praises to the students, and he himself fascinated
and charmed them with his boyish and graceful
presence. As Mrs. Allingham says, everybody in
the schools “adored” him and his work, and on
the opening of the Academy doors on the first
Monday in May the students rushed to his picture
first of all.</p>

<p>To contradict a dictum of Walker’s in those
days was the rankest heresy in a student. Mrs.
Allingham remembers an occasion when a painter
was holding forth on the right methods of water-colour
work, asserting that the paper should be
put flat down on a table, as was the custom with
the old men, and the colour should be laid on in
washes and left to dry with edges, and if Walker
taught any other method he was wrong. Mrs.
Allingham and her fellow-students were furious at
their hero being possibly in fault, and asked for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
opinion of an Academician. His reply was: “And
<i>who</i> is Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, and how does <i>he</i> paint that <i>he</i>
should lay down the law? If Walker <i>is</i> all wrong
with his methods, he paints like an angel.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham’s confession of faith is this:
“I <i>was</i> influenced, doubtless, by his work. I
adored it, but I never consciously copied it. It
revealed to me certain beauties and aspects of
Nature, as du Maurier’s had done, and as North’s
and others have since done, and then I saw like
things for myself in Nature, and painted them, I
truly think, in my own way&mdash;not the best way, I
dare say, but in the only way <i>I</i> could.”</p>

<p>Those, therefore, who discover not the reflection
but the inspiration of Walker in the idyllic grace
of Mrs. Allingham’s figures, and in her treatment
of flowers, place her in a company which she
readily accepts, and is proud of.</p>

<p>But it is with Birket Foster that our artist’s
name has been more intimately linked by the
critics, some even going to the length of asserting
that without him there would have been no Mrs.
Allingham.</p>

<p>Having had the pleasure of an intimacy with
Birket Foster, which extended to writing his
biography (<i>Birket Foster: His Life and Work</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Virtue and Co., 1890), I can emphatically assert
that he never held that opinion, but stated that she
had struck out a line which was entirely her own,
and, as he generously added, “with much more
modernity in it than mine.”</p>

<p>There are, however, so many similarities between
their artistic careers that I may be excused for
dwelling on some of them, for they no doubt
unconsciously influenced not only the method of
their work but the subject of it.</p>

<p>Drawing in black and white on wood in each
case formed the groundwork of their education, and
was only followed by colour at a subsequent stage.</p>

<p>Both, having determined to support themselves,
were fain to seek out the engravers and obtain
from them a livelihood. Birket Foster at sixteen
was fortunate enough to meet in Landells one who
at once recognised his capabilities, whilst Mrs.
Allingham found a similar friend in Joseph Swain.
Again, book illustration was as much in vogue in
1870 as it was in 1842; and by another coincidence
both years witnessed the birth of an illustrated
weekly, for Birket Foster, in 1842, was employed
upon the infant <i>Illustrated London News</i>, while
Mrs. Allingham was the only lady to whom Mr.
Thomas allotted some of the early work on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
<i>Graphic</i>. Differences there were in their opportunities,
and these were not always in the lady’s
favour. Birket Foster found in Landells a man
who looked after his youngster’s education, and,
convinced that Nature was his best mistress, sent
him to her with these instructions: “Now that
work is slack in these summer months, spend them
in the fields; take your colours and copy every
detail of the scene as carefully as possible, especially
trees and foreground plants, and come up to me
once a month and show me what you have done.”
A splendid memory aided Foster in his studies all
too well, for he learnt to draw with such absolute
fidelity every detail that he required, that he never
again required to go to Nature. That he did
so we know from his repeated visits to every part
of Europe&mdash;visits resulting in delightful work;
but what the world saw was entirely studio work,
and this tended to a repetition which oftentimes
marred the entire satisfaction that one otherwise
derived from his drawings. Mrs. Allingham herself,
although living close to and engaged on the
same subjects, never came across him painting out
of doors, and only once saw him note-book in
hand.</p>

<p>Chance influenced the two careers also in another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
way, which might have made any similarity between
them altogether out of question. The first
commission to illustrate a book which Miss Paterson
obtained was a prose work, in which figures and
household scenes entirely predominated,&mdash;in fact,
all her black-and-white work was of this homely
nature,&mdash;and for some years she had no call for the
delineation of landscape. With Foster it was not
very different. It is true that his first commission
was <i>The Boys Spring and Summer Book</i>, in which
he had to draw the seasons, and to draw them
afield. But this might not have attracted him to
landscape work, for his patron’s next commission
was quite in another direction. I may be excused
for referring to it at length, for the little-known
incident is of some interest now that the actors in
it have each achieved such world-wide reputations.
Certain of the young pre-Raphaelites, including
Rossetti, Burne-Jones, and Millais, had been entrusted
with the illustration of <i>Evangeline</i>. The
result was a perfect staggerer to the publisher
Bogue, who was altogether unable to appreciate
their revolutionary methods. “What shall I do
with them?” he was asked by the engraver to
whom he showed the blocks on which most elaborate
designs had been most lovingly drawn.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
“This,” said Bogue, and wetting one of them he
erased the drawing with the sleeve of his coat,
serving each in turn in the same way.</p>

<p>After this drastic treatment the <i>Evangeline</i>
commission was handed over to Birket Foster.
It can be easily imagined with what trepidation
he, knowing these facts, approached and carried out
his task, and his delight when even the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>
could say, “A more lovely book than this has rarely
been given to the public.” The success of the
work was enormous. His career was apparently
henceforth marked out as an illustrator of verse in
black and white, for his popularity continued until
it was not a question of giving him commissions,
but of what book there was for him to illustrate;
and he used laughingly to say that finally there
was nothing left for him but Young’s <i>Night
Thoughts</i> and Pollok’s <i>Course of Time</i>.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that Birket Foster’s art work was
for long confined to subjects as to which he had no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
voice, but which certainly influenced his art, and it
says much for his temperament that throughout it
warranted the term “poetical.” In like manner
it is much to Mrs. Allingham’s credit that her
prosaic start did not prevent the same quality
welling up and being always in evidence in her
productions.</p>

<p>If I have not wearied the reader I would like to
point out some further coincidences in their careers
which are of interest.</p>

<p>Birket Foster became a water-colourist through
the chance that he could not sell his oil-paintings,
which consequently cumbered his small working-room
to such an extent that one night he cut them
all from their stretchers, rolled them up, and sneaking
out, dropped them over Blackfriars Bridge into
the Thames; water-colours cost less to produce
and took up less space, so he adopted them. Mrs.
Allingham abandoned oils after a year or two’s
work in them at the Royal Academy Schools,
because she gradually became convinced that she
could express herself better in water-colours. But
she considered that it was a great advantage to
have worked, even for the short time, in the
stronger medium. It was this practice in oils that
made her for some time (until, indeed, Walker’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
lessons to her at the Royal Academy) use a good
deal of body-colour.</p>

<p>Both artists aspired to obtain the highest rank
which then, as now, is open to the water-colourist,
namely, membership of The Royal Water-Colour
Society, but whilst Birket Foster only attained it
in 1860, in his thirty-fifth year, and at his second
attempt, Mrs. Allingham followed him in 1875,
when only twenty-six, and at her first essay.
Both promptly at once gave up a remunerative
income in black and white, and having done so,
never had cause to regret their decision.</p>

<p>The coincidences do not end even here, for both
within a year or two of their election found themselves,
the one on the invitation of Mr. Hook, R.A.,
the other, twenty years later, for reasons we have
mentioned, settled near the same village, Witley,
in the heart of the country which they have since
identified with their names. Here the selection
of subjects from the same neighbourhood naturally
brought their work still closer together.</p>

<p>Both of them have been attracted to Venice;
Mr. Foster again and again, Mrs. Allingham only
within the last year or two.</p>

<p>Lastly, few artists have been indulged with so
many smiles and so few frowns from the public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
for which they have catered. Birket Foster considered
that he had been almost pampered by the
critics, and Mrs. Allingham has never had the
slightest cause to complain of her treatment at
their hands.</p>

<p>Having dwelt at such length upon the interesting
concurrences in their careers, I now pass on to
a comparison of their methods of work; and here
there are many resemblances, but these are no doubt
due to the times in which they lived. Birket
Foster found himself, when he commenced, the
pupil of a school which had some merits and more
demerits. Composition and drawing were still
thought of, and before a landscape artist presumed
to pose as such, he had to study the laws
which governed the former, and to thoroughly
imbue himself with a knowledge of the anatomy
of what he was about to depict. Mrs. Allingham,
as I have pointed out, was also fortunate enough to
commence her tuition before the fashion of undergoing
this needful apprenticeship died out. But
Birket Foster came at the end of a time when
landscape was painted in the studio rather than in
the field. He went to Nature for suggestions,
which he pencilled into note-books in the most
facile and learned manner, but content with this he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
made his pictures under comfortable conditions at
home. The fulness of his career, too, came at a
time when Art was booming, and the demand for
his work was such that he could not keep pace
with it. It is not surprising, therefore, that in the
zenith of his fame his pictures were, in the main,
studio pictures, worked out with a marvellous
facility of invention, but nevertheless just lacking
that vitality which always pervades work done in
the open air and before Nature.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham’s work at the outset was very
similar to this. For her subject drawings she
made elaborate preliminary studies from Nature
in colour, but the drawing itself was thought and
carried out in the house. Fortunately this method
soon became unpalatable to her, and she gradually
came to work more and more directly from Nature,
and when, at Witley, she found her subjects at her
doors, she discontinued once and for ever her
former method. Since then she has painted every
drawing on the spot during the months that it is
feasible, leaving actual completion for some time,
to enable her to view her work with a fresh eye, and
to study at leisure the final details, such, for instance,
as where the figures shall be grouped, usually
posing, for this purpose, her models in the open air
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
in her Hampstead garden. Her figures are, however,
sometimes culled from careful studies made
in note-books, of which she has an endless supply.
Fastidious to a degree as to the completeness of a
drawing, she lingers long over the finishing touches,
for it is these which she considers make or mar the
whole. Every sort of contrivance she considers to
be legitimate to bring about an effect, save that of
body-colour, which she holds in abhorrence; but
the knife, a hard brush, a pointed stick, a paint
rag, and a sponge are in constant request.</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham is above all things a fair-weather
painter. She has no pleasure in the storm, whether
of rain or wind. Maybe this avoidance of the
discomforts inseparable from a truthful portrayal
of such conditions indicates the femininity of her
nature. Doubtless it does. But is she to blame?
Her work is framed upon the pleasure that it
affords her, and it is certain that the result is none
the less satisfactory because it only numbers the
sunny hours and the halcyon days.</p>

<p>I ought perhaps to have qualified the expression
“sunny hours,” for as a rule she does not affect a
sunshine which casts strong shadows, but rather
its condition when, through a thin veil of cloud, it
suffuses all Nature with an equable light, and allows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
local colour to be seen at its best. In drawings
which comprise any large amount of floral detail,
the leaves, in full sunshine, give off an amount of
reflected light that materially lessens the colour
value of the flowers, and prevents their being
properly distinguished. Mr. Elgood, the painter
of flower-gardens <i>par excellence</i>, always observes
this rule, not only because the effect is so much
more satisfactory on paper, but because it is so
much easier to paint under this aspect. As regards
sky treatment, both he and Mrs. Allingham, it will
be noted, confine themselves to the simplest sky
effects, feeling that the main interest lies on the
ground, where the detail is amply sufficient to
warrant the accessories being kept as subservient
as possible. For this reason it is that the glories
of sunrise and sunset have no place in Mrs. Allingham’s
work, the hours round mid-day sufficing for
her needs.</p>

<p>To the curiously minded concerning her palette,
it may be said that it is of the simplest character.
Her paint-box is the smallest that will hold her
colours in moist cake form, of which none are used
save those which she considers to be permanent.
It contains cobalt, permanent yellow, aureolin, raw
sienna, yellow ochre, cadmium, rose madder, light
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
red, and sepia. She now uses nothing save O.W.
(old water-colour) paper. Mrs. Allingham’s method
of laying on the colour differs from that of Birket
Foster, who painted wet and in small touches.
Her painting is on the dry side, letting her colours
mingle on the paper. As a small bystander once
remarked concerning it, “You do mess about a
deal.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Allingham has been a constant worker for
upwards of a quarter of a century, during which
time, in addition to contributing to the Royal
Society, she has held seven Exhibitions at The
Fine Art Society’s, each of them averaging some
seventy numbers. She has, therefore, upon her
own calculation, put forth to the world nearly a
thousand drawings. In spite of this, they seldom
appear in the sale-room, and when they do they
share with Birket Foster’s work the unusual distinction
of always realising more than the artist
received for them.</p>

<p>The illustrations which adorn this closing chapter
have no connection with its subject, but are not
on that account altogether out of place; for they
are the only ones which are outside the title of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
work, two being from Ireland, and two from Venice,
and they are associated with two of the main incidents
of the artist’s life, namely, her marriage, and
her only art work abroad.</p>

<p>Ballyshannon is the birthplace of Mr. William
Allingham, who married Mrs. Allingham in 1874.
It is situated in County Donegal, and was described
by him as “an odd, out-of-the way little town on
the extreme western verge of Europe; our next
neighbours, sunset way, being citizens of the great
Republic, which indeed to our imagination seemed
little, if at all, farther off than England in the
opposite direction. Before it spreads a great ocean,
behind stretches many an islanded lake. On the
south runs a wavy line of blue mountains, and on
the north, over green, rocky hills, rise peaks of a
more distant range. The trees hide in glens or
cluster near the river; grey rocks and boulders lie
scattered about the windy pastures.” Here Mr.
Allingham was born of the good old stock of one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Cromwell’s settlers, and here he lived until he was
two-and-twenty. The drawing now reproduced
was made when Mrs. Allingham visited the place
with his children after his death in 1889. Many
ruined cabins lie around; money is scarce in
Donegal, and each year the tenants become fewer,
some emigrating, others who have done so sending
to their relations to join them. Better times are
indeed necessary if the country is not to become a
desert.</p>

<p>The Fairy Bridges&mdash;a series of natural arches,
carved or shaken out of the cliffs, in times long past,
by the rollers of the Atlantic&mdash;are within a walk
of Ballyshannon, and were often visited by Mrs.
Allingham during her stay there. Three of them
(there are five in all) are seen in the drawing, and
a quaint and mythological faith connects them
with Elfindom&mdash;a faith which every Irishman in
the last generation imbibed with his mother’s milk,
and which is not yet extinct in the lovely crags
and glens of Donegal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>The scene is introduced into two of Mr. Allingham’s
best-known songs; in one, “The Fairies,”
thus&mdash;</p>

<p>The only land which separates the wind-swept
Fairy Bridges from America is the Slieve-League
headland, whose wavy outline is seen in the distance.
It, too, finds a place in one of Mr. Allingham’s
songs, “The Winding Banks of Erne: the
Emigrant’s Adieu to his Birthplace” (which in
ballad form is sung by Erin’s children all the

SALUTE, VENICE<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Water-colour in the possession of Mr. C. P. Johnson.</i><br />

Painted 1901.</span></h3>

<p>Mrs. Allingham, after an absence of thirty-three
years, visited Italy again in 1901, in company with
a fellow-artist, and the following year the Exhibition
of the Old Water-Colour Society was rendered
additionally interesting by a comparison of her
rendering of Venice with that of a fellow lady-member,
Miss Clara Montalba, to whose individuality
in dealing with it we have before referred.</p>

<p>The drawing of Mrs. Allingham’s here reproduced
shows Venice in quite an English aspect as
regards weather. It is almost a grey day; it
certainly is a fresh one, and has nothing in common
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
with one which induces the spending of much
time about in a gondola.</p>

<p>In selecting the Salute for one of her principal
illustrations of Venice, Mrs. Allingham has respectfully
followed in the footsteps of England’s greatest
landscapist, for Turner made it the main object in
his great effort of the Grand Canal, and there are
few of the craft who have failed to limn it again
and again in their story of Venice.</p>

<p>But whilst most people are disposed to regard
it as one of the most beautiful features of the
city, the church has fallen under the ban of
those exponents of architecture that have studied
it carefully.</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin classified it under the heading of
“Grotesque Renaissance,” although he admitted
that its position, size, and general proportions
rendered it impressive. Its proportions were
good, but its graceful effect was due to the inequality
in the size of its cupolas and the pretty
grouping of the campaniles behind them. But
he qualified his praise by an opinion that the
proportions of buildings have nothing whatever
to do with the style or general merits of their
architecture, for an artist trained in the worst
schools, and utterly devoid of all meaning and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
purpose in his work, may yet have such a natural
gift of massing or grouping as will render all his
structures effective when seen from a distance.
Such a gift was very general with the late Italian
builders, so that many of the most contemptible
edifices in the country have a good stage effect so
long as we do not approach them. The Church
of the Salute is much assisted by the beautiful
flight of steps in front of it down to the Canal,
and its fa&ccedil;ade is rich and beautiful of its kind.
What raised the anger of Ruskin was the disguise
of the buttresses under the form of colossal
scrolls, the buttresses themselves being originally a
hypocrisy, for the cupola is of timber, and therefore
needs none.</p>

<h3>81. A FRUIT STALL, VENICE<br />

<span class="small"><i>From the Drawing, the property of Mr. C. P. Johnson.</i><br />

Painted 1902.</span></h3>

<p>A lover of gardens and their produce, such as
Mrs. Allingham is, could not visit Venice without
being captivated by the wealth of colour which
Nature has lavished upon the contents of the
Venetian fruit stalls. Even the most indifferent,
when they get into meridional parts, cannot be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
insensible to the luscious hues which the fruit
baskets display. To look out of the window of
one’s hotel on an Italian lake-side at dawn and see
the boats coming from all quarters of the lake
laden with the luscious tomatoes, plums, and other
fruits, is not among the least of the delights of a
sojourn there. Mrs. Allingham’s drawing bears
upon its face evidences that it is a literal translation
of the scene. We have none of the introduction
of stage accessories in the way of secchios and
other studio belongings which find a place in
most of the Venetian output of this character.
She has evidently delighted in the mysteries of
the tones of the wicker baskets, for we recognise
in them traces of the skill she achieves in England
in the delineation of similar surfaces on her tiled
roofs. Her figure, too, has nothing of the studio
model in it. This black-haired girl is a new type
for her, but it is a faithful transcript of the original,
and not one of the robust beauties which one is
accustomed to in the pictures of Van Haanen and
his followers. The stall itself was located somewhere
between the Campo San Stefano and the
Rialto.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>With these illustrations of Mrs. Allingham’s
painting elsewhere than in England our tale is
told. We trust that this digression, which appeared
to be necessary if a complete survey of the
artist’s lifework up to the present time was to be
portrayed, will not be deemed to have appreciably
affected the appropriateness of the title to the
volume, nor invalidated the claim that we have
made as to her work having most felicitously represented
the fairest aspects of English life and
landscape&mdash;English life, whether of peer, commoner,
or peasant, passed under its healthiest and
happiest conditions, and English landscape under
spring and summer skies and dressed in its most
beauteous array of flower and foliage&mdash;an England
of which we may to-day be as proud as were
those who lived when the immortal lines concerning
it were penned:&mdash;</p>

 The model was a Mrs. Stewart, who, with her husband, sat to Mrs.

charge of the Hogarth Club, Fitzroy Square, when Mrs. Allingham,
before her marriage, lived in Southampton Row close by. She introduced
the models to Mr. du Maurier, who immediately engaged them,
and continued to use them for many years. “Ponsonby de Tompkins”

the risk of fire. Since the introduction of coal, chimneys clog much
more readily with soot, and a fire from one of these with its showers of
sparks may quickly set ablaze not only the cottage where this happens,
but the whole village. That the insurance companies, by their higher
premiums for thatch-covered houses, recognise a greater risk, may or
may not be proof of greater liability to conflagration, but we certainly
nowadays hear of much fewer of those disasters, which even persons

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
